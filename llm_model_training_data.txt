text May 03, 2023, Karachi: Unilever Pakistan hosted an interactive dialogue to discuss the importance of living wages in Pakistan. The session focused on the benefits of fair pay and living wages to businesses, communities, and the country. A living wage accounts for the diverse lifestyle needs of a person in line with their present economic realities so they can afford a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his family. Living wages consider needs around healthcare, shelter, nutrition, educational expenses, utilities, emergency funds for an average household.
The round table brought together industry leaders and organisations that have taken up the mission of providing better livelihoods to their workers in Pakistan. Leaders from Jazz, Bank Alfalah, Careem, and foodpanda, along with senior officials from OICCI, Rozee.pk, Naya Jeevan and ABHI, participated in the strategic alliance as active enablers for the living wage mission. Each organization brought their own unique perspective and experiences around their efforts to ensure the socioeconomic uplift and financial wellbeing of their own and associated workforce. The discussion also included celebrity and social activist Shahzad Roy, and renowned economist Habib Paracha on the table.
The dialogue session provided a platform for participants to share their experiences and challenges as well as explore opportunities for collective action. Unilever Pakistan, the enabler for this strategic alliance, has already made significant progress towards this goal; while the company’s directly employed employees are already well above the living wage, the organisation has further shifted 60% of its outer core, which includes an indirect workforce of over 12,000 people in their business value chain, to an average living wage of PKR 52,000 with the goal to transition the remaining by 2025.
Sharing his remarks, Amir Paracha, CEO of Unilever Pakistan stated, "At Unilever, we firmly believe that living wages are crucial for people and businesses, and our vision under ‘Unilever for Pakistan’ is to make living wages a national benchmark. We are proud to bring together organizations that share the similar values and are committed to improving the lives and livelihoods of workers across Pakistan through fair wages."
Aamir Ibrahim, CEO Jazz, said that the organization believes in fairness and equity in the workplace, and has taken various measures to prioritize employee well-being despite challenging times for the company.
He further said that Jazz recently provided a one-time inflation adjustment payout of up to PKR 50,000 for our frontline and contractual employees falling within a certain salary bracket. “Additionally, we set the minimum wage for our permanent employees to PKR 62,000, and our support and technical staff received a double-digit salary increment,” he informed.
Faisal Khan, Group Head HR & Learning Bank Alfalah, said that “At Bank Alfalah, we are making groundbreaking efforts to streamline and enhance the working environment while empowering employees by promoting comprehensive Employee Benefit Policies such as benchmarking living wage and increasing retirement age to 65.”
Appreciating the efforts, Imran Saleem, General Manager Ride Hailing at Careem Pakistan stated, “Careem's purpose is simplifying and improving the lives of people in the region. This purpose comes hand-in-hand with creating income generating opportunities for the masses. In addition to maintaining fair living wages for our colleagues, we have been blessed with the opportunity to provide 820,000+ Captains a means to earn a decent livelihood. I am delighted to see like-minded organisations share a similar mission to provide fair living wages within their ecosystem, and their efforts on implementation.”
CEO foodpanda, Muntaqa Peracha commented, "At foodpanda, we are proud of the initiatives we have taken to support our riders and ensure they earn above the minimum wage. We provide a transparent payment system, necessary equipment, rewards and incentives programs to recognize their hard work. We remain committed to supporting our riders and creating a positive impact on their lives, enabling us to deliver exceptional service to our customers and remain a leading food delivery platform."
The dialogue session came at a crucial time, following Labour Day and in the context of a challenging socio-economic environment. It came as an opportunity for industry leaders to come together, learn from one another, and work towards a common goal of building a more prosperous, sustainable, and inclusive society.
With its global goal of ‘Fairer pay for a fairer world’, Unilever Pakistan understands that the economic growth is only inclusive and sustainable when workers receive fair wages. This strategic alliance will help partner organizations learn for each other’s experiences, and collectively take the next steps towards making living wages a national benchmark.

text Cornetto, first produced in 1976 in Italy, has since risen to become one of Unilever’s Ice Cream power Brands worldwide. Cornetto was introduced in Pakistan in 1995.
Known for its unique chocolate tip trademark, Cornetto has been for decades one the world's most famous and popular ice-creams. Cornetto's soft creamy core, crunchy wafer, and delicious chocolate ending make it an existing journey of tastes and textures from the first bite to the last. Cornetto was born in 1959, when Spica, an Italian ice-cream manufacturer based in Naples, came up with a groundbreaking innovation: to create the world's first packaged ice cream cone by insulating the wafer from the ice-cream with a special coating of chocolate.
The Cornetto experience consists of a delicious, crispy-baked wafer, coated inside from top to bottom with a chocolate layer, with rich creamy frozen dessert inside, and topped off with sauce and chocolate chips, with a crunchy chocolate plug at the wafer cone from top to end of the product finishing the experience on a delicious high note.
Cornetto cones were first produced in 1976 in Naples by an Italian ice-cream manufacturer, Spica. From the time Unilever bought Spica and began to market the product throughout Europe Cornetto has been one of Wall’s biggest power brands across numerous countries world-wide. Cornetto is one of the first Brands that were introduced on Wall’s launch in Pakistan. Cornetto is not only available in traditional Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry flavors but has also been available in Caramel, Cappuccino and supplementary flavor variations.
Cornetto has been promoting local music in Pakistan for years, partnering with Noori, Jal and Call to name a few. In 2013 Cornetto launched “Cornetto Music Icons” a music show where past and present stars of the music industry provided mentoring to promising new talent.
Cornetto seeks to continuously enthrall consumers with new flavors and keeps them engaged through larger than life campaigns, culminating with the launch of Fruity Yo, a frozen yoghurt and blueberry flavoured variant, in 2012 and Black & White, a mixed white chocolate and dark chocolate flavored variant, in 2013.

text Great flavor is at the heart of Knorr, Unilever’s biggest foods brand.
Knorr is a food brand with a wide range of soups, stock cubes, bouillons, seasonings and sauces. The brand dates back to 1838 when Carl Heinrich Knorr opened a factory and began experimenting with food drying techniques that could preserve quality, flavour and freshness. It is one of the world‘s largest food brands sold in more than 87 countries around the world.
Great flavour is at the heart of the Knorr brand. Which is why we go the extra mile to work with some of the best chefs around the world to develop authentic and nutritious meal solutions.
Established as early as 1873, Knorr was created with the purpose of providing high quality dried soups. Carl Heinrich Knorr, born in 1800, created the company from knowledge acquired during his time as a wholesaler of agricultural goods. He died 2 years after the company was founded but his legacy lives on as Knorr is known today for chefmanship and great tasting food.
Knorr came to Pakistan in 1992 with the launch of Knorr Chicken Cubes. In the passing years Knorr introduced multiple Savoury, Dressing and Meal Maker products. We at Knorr believe that cooking delicious and nutritious food should be in every woman’s’ reach. It is this love and passion for flavor, that drives us to go the extra mile to ensure each dish you create, delivers great taste. Our products include:
Noodles
Cubes
Tomato Ketchup & Chilli Garlic Sauce
Soups
Seasoning
Knorr Noodles
Knorr launched Instant Noodles range in Pakistan in 1993. Knorr Noodles have become the brand of choice for kids over the years. Exciting new flavours, developed to suit the local taste palette, have been a major source of gain, which has continued to make food “No More Boring” for the kids. The magic of Knorr Noodles tells its success story when its aroma floats from every kitchen onto our dining tables putting smiles on every face. Chatpatta and Chicken flavors are a favorite throughout Pakistan. Knorr Noodles is now the market leader for the instant noodles market, at a record 95% market share!

text Domex Toilet Expert’s mission is to make all the toilets of Pakistan cleaner, safer and germ-free.
Domex (known in many countries as Domestos) is a powerful, quick-acting bleach. The brand was launched in the UK in the 1920s and was sold door-to-door by salesmen on bicycles. At that time, it was used in the home as a solution to whiten cotton and household surfaces, and salesmen were assigned to do live demos. Today it is sold all over the world. The brand is active in its sustainability work to extend access to toilets in disadvantaged parts of the world.
Domex Toilet Expert – kills all sickness causing germs
In every age, and across every culture, women have aspired to make their homes a safe haven for their families. Not just a clean home but a healthy home. In her role as champion of the home; the home is her domain and therefore under her protection. Protection against the unclean and here she could really do with some help. Help to be safe from the unseen danger of germs and bad bacteria.
The germ threat!
Germs bring sickness and disease into the home. They sit on surfaces, they hide in corners and cracks –– they lie in wait. Germs among other places also originate from the toilet and threaten the health of the family, and cause diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid.
Germs cannot be seen. They are as likely to be there on a spotless surface as in some damp and dirty place. Just because it looks clean doesn’t mean it is clean – not hygienically clean. Upon flushing, germs actually escape from the toilet bowl and travel up to 3-4 feet to land on toothbrushes, towels and other surfaces. Germs breed fast. A couple of germs can become a million in a just a few hours. So germs are an unseen, rapidly breeding danger.
The Germ Kill Expert
Unfortunately for the germs, their days of reigning and disease-spreading in the toilet are over. Domex has entered Pakistan and is causing the extermination of toilet germs all over the country. Domex falls under the domain of the global Unilever brand Domestos, which has existed since 1929 maintaining its stronghold in countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, Vietnam and many more.
Powerful Domex Toilet Bleach with its specialized hypochlorite formulation kills all sickness causing germs completely as well as removing all types of dirt and stains completely. What is even better is that Domex is the only toilet cleaner that can be used for all surfaces in the toilet; in effect being the complete toilet cleaning and hygiene solution.
Domex comes to Pakistan
Domex Toilet Expert has landed in Pakistan and continue on in its mission to make all the toilets of Pakistan cleaner, safer and completely germ-free.
Domex is available in 4 different variants, each of which have a unique fragrance
Domex Original
Pink Power
Pine Blast
Lemon Explosion

text Surf Excel is a 110+ year-old global Unilever brand which exists in various countries under the brand names of Omo, Rinso, Skip & Surf Excel. In Pakistan, the brand was launched as Surf in 1948, and has a deep-rooted heritage which has made it a national icon.
Surf Excel (also known as Surf in many parts of the world) is a brand of laundry detergent with an accompanying range of laundry products. It launched in 1959 and is now available in Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with a comprehensive range of offerings including bars, powders, liquids, tablets and capsules.
Surf Excel is known for its famous tagline ‘Daag tou achay hotay hain/Dirt is good’. But this is much more than just a tagline. It is a central philosophy that the brand lives by, with an intrinsic passion to ensure child development through tactile learning. Over the years, the brand has worked hard to build awareness on the importance of child learning through experience.
Dirt is a natural part of the process of children experiencing life and developing. There are small rights that allow children to live fully, such as playing in a park without the fear of getting dirty or painting a flower pot without a care about paint stains. All these little but crucial experiences help nurture creativity, and build confidence in a child.
Although child development is at the very heart of Surf Excel's message, this would not be possible without the superior stain removal properties that come with every bag of Surf Excel. Its ability to remove a wide variety of stains effectively is what gives Surf Excel users the ability to break free from the mundane and become liberated.
Because Surf Excel is so good at cleaning, you don’t have to worry about getting dirty, therefore you can give your kids the freedom to experience and truly engage with life and grow and develop at the same time.

Does Unilever test any of its products on animals? 
Our commitment to ending animal testing is under-pinned by our research since the 1980s to develop alternatives to animal tests for assessing safety. We routinely use a wide range of non-animal approaches to assess the safety of our products for consumers. We do not test our products on animals, but occasionally some ingredients we use have been tested to meet government requirements. A few governments still test our products on animals in their own laboratories, and we are working with these authorities to help them adopt non-animal approaches.
Our leading-edge research has one clear purpose: to continue to develop new non-animal approaches that can guarantee our products are safe. We are making good progress in developing a non-animal approach for assessing the safety of ingredients that may cause skin allergy. Information about our research strategy and partners is available on our Safety Science in the 21st Century website. Find out more

I am interested in finding out more about the history of Unilever. How did the Company begin? 
Unilever has a rich and colourful history spanning more than 70 years. Unilever was formed in 1930 when the Dutch margarine company, Margarine Unie, merged with British soapmaker Lever Brothers. Both companies were competing for the same raw materials, both were involved in the large-scale marketing of household products and both used similar distribution channels. Between them they had operations in over 40 countries. Lever Brothers was founded in 1885 by William Hesketh Lever. Lever established soap factories around the world. In 1917, he began to diversify into foods, acquiring fish, ice cream and canned foods businesses.

text Our Living Wage Journey
All workers are entitled to a Living Wage. It ensures that workers can live with dignity and security. It empowers them to take care of themselves and their families and contributes to their overall well-being. Unilever Pakistan thus believes that a Living Wage is the cornerstone of a just and equitable society.
It is a measure of the minimum income that a worker must earn to meet their basic needs such as health, education, sustenance, and social security, which the current minimum wage system may not be able to provide for an essential standard of living. When workers earn a Living Wage, they are more productive, motivated, and committed to their jobs, leading to improved performance and a better working environment for all. 
As of April 2023, 58% of our workforce is earning a Living Wage.
Guddi Baji Livelihoods Program
In 2012, Unilever Pakistan developed a partnership and consortium with a local social welfare organization, the Rural Support Program Network, to connect with the most vulnerable people in local communities. Through this platform, we have created an entrepreneurial movement whereby women in villages are given an opportunity to act as ambassadors and route-to-market agents for Unilever Pakistan, providing a means of income for them to support their families. This model incorporates recruitment, training and capability building via comprehensive training tools, focusing on techniques to run profitable businesses. This model was dubbed the Guddi Baji Livelihoods Program.
From its first ever salon model in 2012 to its retail operations from 2015 to 2018, to its partnerships with JazzCash and the Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN) in 2019, more than 8000 women have been trained and enabled as entrepreneurs.
The latest Guddi Baji iteration facilitated a partnership with Jazz, the largest telecommunications company in Pakistan. Both organisations leveraged their core competencies to increase the value of their products and drive financial inclusion for low-income women in Pakistan.

In 2022, we pivoted from our aim of being the top employer of choice in the country to becoming the most inclusive employer of choice. To this end, we doubled down on our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) efforts. We launched the UPLIFT Inclusion Trainee program whereby we hired 16 persons with disability and a transgender person on a trainee program intended to provide them with a level playing field to build their career. ​
Gender is another area of our core focus and to enable our women employees to succeed to senior leadership positions within the organization, we launched the #SheForShe program to provide mentorship to women by women leaders of Unilever Pakistan. ​
In a rapidly changing world, we also want to ensure that our people remain future-fit to adapt to the new ways of working with agility and mastery. We launched a Digital University for our employees which features learning modules and pathways to upskill and build capability on digital transformation. ​
Employee wellbeing remains our key focus especially in a post-pandemic, inflationary world and we offer our employees access to round-the-clock mental wellbeing resources through our trained Mental Health champions and our round-the-clock confidential Employee Assistance Program for counselling. ​
Employee safety is a non-negotiable for us and we continue to prioritize safety of our people and contractors from our offices, factories to on-the-job travel. With stringent safety protocols and regular safety advisories communicated across the value chain, we are constantly striving to keep our people safe.​

text Karachi, August 9, 2023: Unilever Pakistan and HANDS Pakistan have rehabilitated the village of Essa Rajero, Thatta, which was devastated by the floods of 2022.
Following the catastrophic floods, Unilever Pakistan had announced an "Adopt a Village" project to create model communities in flood-affected areas. As part of this effort, Unilever Pakistan adopted villages in Thatta and D.G. Khan. In partnership with HANDS Pakistan, this initiative has developed resilient communities with sustainable houses and basic infrastructure, providing WASH services, access to clean water energy, and education.
The program also focuses on equipping flood-affected individuals with skills and resources necessary to diversify their livelihood options. With this vision, Unilever Pakistan and HANDS have established a Community-Based Organization (CBO) comprising local community members, which assumes a pivotal role in both decision-making processes and the village's reconstruction efforts.
The organization has successfully built 90 houses in the village that has helped the communities rebuild their lives. The development work is complete, and people have been made self-reliant and resilient in the face of future challenges.
Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan, highlighted, “The aftermath of such disasters often leaves families grappling with the loss of their homes and livelihoods. In response to these challenges, ‘Unilever for Pakistan’ stands as a multi-faceted effort to rebuild lives. With profound responsibility to contribute to relief and rehabilitation of the flood affectees, our focus remains climate preparedness and climate resilience.”
Additionally, according to Dr. Shaikh Tanveer Ahmed, CE of HANDS Pakistan, "People frequently find themselves struggling with the catastrophic loss of their homes and livelihoods after significant calamities such as floods. 'HANDS Pakistan' arises as a comprehensive project dedicated to rebuilding destroyed lives and rehabilitation in response to these daunting problems. HANDS Pakistan has a firm commitment to helping people impacted by the floods.”
In 2022, Unilever Pakistan’s response to the floods included emergency relief with provision of ration packs, cooked meals, hygiene kits, and medical camps. The organization’s brands also actively participated, with Lifebuoy setting up floating medical clinics to provide easy access to doctors and medicines and Surf Excel launching a ‘clothes donation drive’ to provide clean clothes.
Pakistan is anticipated to face severe climate-related incidents, which underscores the concept of constructing model villages. The purpose behind this endeavor is to equip at-risk communities, enhancing their capacity to withstand and respond effectively to such events in the coming years. Building resilient communities involves fostering a sense of togetherness and collaboration. Unilever stays committed to encouraging active community building and fostering a supportive environment for individuals to regain their footing and rebuild their lives.
text Unilever is inviting startups, students, micro-small-medium enterprises, and individuals to join its groundbreaking "Accelerating Plastic Reduction" program. Launching in May, 2023 in Pakistan, this program offers a unique opportunity to propose solutions to reduce plastic waste and make a positive impact on the environment. This is a one-of-its-kind chance to be part of the solution and make a real difference in the fight against plastic waste. This is an open invitation for working together towards a cleaner, more sustainable future!
The program, which will launch in Pakistan in May 2023, will focus on two key areas, including conducting research to understand the challenges of the informal recycling and repurposing economy and an acceleration program to develop and scale enterprises in the plastic recycling and collection business.
Through the “Accelerating Plastic Reduction” program, Unilever aims to build an ecosystem that resolves plastic pollution by working with the informal sector, accelerating the growth of organizations in the plastic collection and recycling business, and identifying sustainable interventions. The program will also offer mentoring, capacity-building, and networking opportunities to the selected teams.
Speaking at the partnership, Amir Paracha, CEO Unilever Pakistan shared, "We are excited to partner with SEED in this journey of creating a circular economy. At Unilever, we believe that our business can only thrive if the communities and ecosystems in which we operate are also thriving. By investing in innovative and sustainable practices, we are not only contributing to the well-being of Pakistani, but also to the long-term health of our planet. We look forward to working together with SEED to drive positive impact and create a more sustainable future for all."
Adding, Shaista Ayesha, CEO at SEED said, " SEED is proud to partner with Unilever in this initiative to reduce plastic waste and create a more sustainable future. By providing access to mentorship, capacity building, and financial assistance, we hope to accelerate the growth of enterprises in the plastic collection and recycling business, while also identifying sustainable interventions. We believe that by working with startups, students, micro-small-medium enterprises, and individuals, we can build a diverse ecosystem that fosters innovation and positive impact on the environment. We look forward to the positive impact this program will have on Pakistan and beyond."
Unilever’s “Accelerating Plastic Reduction” program is part of its commitment to reducing plastic waste, which includes halving its use of virgin plastic and helping to collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells by 2025. The program will enable Unilever to gain an understanding of current market developments, trends, and technologies in the space while building capacity, creating success stories, and making a positive impact on the environment.

text Thursday, May 12, 2022: Unilever Pakistan has partnered with Akhuwat and NOWPDP to develop an inclusive and sustainable recruitment process to ensure equitable employment opportunities across the business in Pakistan.
The launch of the program follows a long-standing commitment by Unilever Pakistan to drive inclusion in the workplace. With a dedicated Diversity & Inclusion team, the organization has carried out several successful initiatives to achieve an inclusive culture across its ecosystem with the use of tools for fair recruitment, and specific goals for inclusion.
The current initiative also aims to enable specially-abled persons and transgender persons with the professional tools necessary to succeed in corporate careers. As part of this ambition, Unilever Pakistan is launching a one-year contract Trainee program, which is designed to upskill participants and prepare them for entry into their preferred career roles.
Amir Paracha, Chairman & CEO, Unilever Pakistan highlighted, “Diversity and inclusion are among the greatest catalysts for social and economic change globally, and having a balanced workforce should be a requirement, not an aspiration. We aim to enable equitable opportunities for employment across our value chain and this partnership is yet another milestone for increasing livelihoods for all segments of society.”
Omair Ahmad, CEO NOWPDP also added that, “With grit, we have solicited staunch supporters from the grassroots up and have laid the foundation on which we are able to stand strong. Working towards our mandate of economic empowerment of persons with disabilities, we look forward to creating a more Bashamool Pakistan through our partnership with Unilever.”
NOWPDP works to promote an inclusive society through holistic and sustainable endeavors in the areas of education and economic empowerment for persons with disabilities. Akhuwat, through its Khwajasira Support Program, carries out economic and social interventions to support the transgender community through direct financial assistance, health services, psychological support, and participation in this training.
text Unilever Pakistan has set itself the target to collect, recycle and repurpose more plastic than it produces by 2025. The public space is set up as part of the continuing effort to recycle and repurpose plastic to reduce waste and give plastic a second life. The Public Space includes a play area and benches for the people of Karachi, which have been made from over 2,500 kilos of recycled plastic. This plastic was collected as part of Unilever’s ongoing commitment to recycle two million kilos of plastic across Pakistan in 2021.
Administrator Karachi Laeeq Ahmed said infrastructure improvement works were being carried out in the city with the coordination of civil society and welfare organizations. Tree plantation campaign was successfully going on in Karachi and thousands of saplings had been planted in parks and around major roads. Along with repair and maintenance of roads, streetlights are made functional to light up main corridors. The Administrator thanked Unilever Pakistan for setting up a public space at Frere Gardens to create awareness about plastic recycling in Pakistan.
Mr Taha Saleem, Director General, Parks & Horticulture Department, KMC, said, “the step taken by Unilever Pakistan will help recycle plastic in the city.” He thanked the Unilever team for making it happen in Karachi.
Mr Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan highlighted, “Unilever Pakistan is fully committed towards reducing the impact of plastic waste and building a circular economy through bold, consistent and rigorous action. We aim to collect more plastic than we produce and make our packaging material sustainable. This public space is a humble attempt at starting public dialog amongst our citizens about the need for recycling plastic in Pakistan.”
Unilever Pakistan is also investing in models that help in creating a circular economy and drive economic empowerment and livelihood opportunities for people as part of the #UnileverForPakistan initiative. The company recently announced projects for a plastic waste free model city in Rahim Yar Khan, as well as brand led initiatives on sustainable plastic reuse. These collaborations are part of Unilever Pakistan’s larger vision on environment action and the global Plastics commitments to cut down its use of virgin plastic, use reusable and recyclable plastic packaging and especially, collect and process more plastic than it produces.

text Unilever Pakistan has collected and recycled plastic waste equivalent to half (50%) of the plastic used in its operations annually. This has been achieved in a period of two years, as part of the ambition of becoming 100% plastic neutral by 2025.
Last year, Unilever Pakistan had pledged to recover, recycle and reuse 100% of the plastic generated through its operations by 2025. As part of this effort, the company partnered with stakeholders from the industry, government, and the development sector to eradicate plastic waste and invest in initiatives to reuse and repurpose plastic.
Amir Paracha,Chairman & CEO, Unilever Pakistan said on the occasion, “Protecting the world from the impact of climate change needs all of us to work collaboratively. Reducing the plastic footprint is just one aspect of this cause and one organization alone cannot turn the tide. We must work together to find innovative ways to amplify the impact of positive climate actions to create a greener, cleaner, and more prosperous world for everyone.”
The announcement was made as part of celebrations of World Environment Day 2022, where Unilever Pakistan announced the results of a recent partnership, titled ‘Dastan-e-Plastic’ with ISP Environmental Solutions for the collection of plastic waste in Lahore. The effort is part of a pilot project, collecting plastic waste from 5,440 households in Lahore. The project is expected to become self-sustaining by the end of 2022 and provides sustainable employment for 22 scavengers and 21 informal recyclers (kabaris).
On the day, Unilever Pakistan also signed an MoU with Sharmeen Polymers to use recycled plastic in the packaging material developed for Unilever products. The Research and Development team at Unilever Pakistan and Sharmeen Polymers are collaborating to develop Pakistan’s first shampoo bottle, using locally sourced recycled plastic. Unilever Pakistan is also a founding member of Pakistan’s first packaging alliance CoRe (Collect & Recycle), working to responsibly produce and recycle consumer plastic.

text H for Handwashing 
Washing your hands with soap may sound simple but it has been proven to significantly reduce the transmission of disease. Yet Pakistanis, on average, wash their hands with soap just once a day. Poor hand hygiene drives up the incidence of bacterial illnesses and may prove to be fatal. Millions of children in Pakistan have lost their lives to easily preventable diseases such as diarrhea and flu.
Lifebuoy is committed to improving hand hygiene in Pakistan and does so with multiple initiatives. Since 2010, Lifebuoy has been extending the message of health and hygiene in Pakistan through its Handwashing awareness program. The program aims to inform mothers and children about the importance of proper hygiene behaviors and boasts a vast urban and rural footprint.
Every year on Global Handwashing Day (GHD), Lifebuoy Pakistan partners with like-minded organizations to further propel the “H for Handwashing” movement. Our commitment is not limited to a single day; we aim to promote handwashing to over 1 million children in partnership with The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and WaterAid in 2023.
+1 Millionpeople reached
Our Covid Response – Haathon ki Hifazat, Pakistan ki Hifazat
Lifebuoy became the first brand in Pakistan to launch Public Service Announcements for COVID in 2020. The brand’s response centered around awareness announcements on TV & Digital advocating for the use of any soap. These announcements were aired on multiple mediums including morning shows and Ramadan transmissions and reached millions of viewers. 
In order to maximize the impact of its PSA, Lifebuoy collaborated with pakistani celebrities and influencers who spread the message to their fans. Additionally, Lifebuoy established more than 190 handwash stations across the country in collaboration with the government, petrol stations, schools, and other partners to further maximize impact.
25millionpeople reached on TV
5.7millionpeople reached on print media
21.7millionpeople reached on digital media
194+handwash stations deployed in 20 cities
Free tele-consultations for a healthier Pakistan
For more than a century, Lifebuoy has been on a mission of saving lives. While the heart of our brand has always been a lifesaving product, we have also developed an eco-system of product and service. This has set the gold standard for hygiene in Pakistan. In service to this vision, Lifebuoy partnered with Sehat Kahani to launch a telehealth service across Pakistan.
With our toll-free helpline number printed on the pack, we were able to distribute 45 million telehealth packs nationwide and reach 28 million Pakistanis every month through our awareness campaign. In 2022 alone, we have been able to facilitate over 20,000 consultations for issues ranging from pain management to diarrhea etc.
Providing relief to flood affectees
In the summer of 2022, many areas in Pakistan witnessed catastrophic floods. Around 33 million people were affected by the heavy rains and floods. An estimated 7.9 million people suffered displacement and of these, 598,000 are living in relief camps.
Our telehealth helpline witnessed a 30 percent increase in calls during mid-June and July. As we ramped up our telehealth service to address the influx of incoming calls, Lifebuoy also stepped up to play its part during this unprecedented crisis.
Lifebuoy donated 0.4 million soaps to flood-affected victims across the country. We understand that immediate relief and donations can only go so far; the flood-affected areas and survivors would need long-term support to navigate the destruction caused by the floods. 
Consequently, Lifebuoy initiated a mobile health clinic with our partner Sehat Kahani. Through this mobile clinic, we aim to reach 0.5 million victims and cover 15 districts across the east and west bank of the River Indus. ​Our clinic is fully equipped with doctors and medical equipment and is part of a 3-month holistic initiative.
Confidence and Wellbeing
We believe a more inclusive society will be a healthier one.

The goal is to promote awareness about the importance of women learning how to ride safely, thus broadening their horizons for all aspects of their lives.
Bridging the gender gap
The presence of cultural taboos and societal pressures in Pakistan holds many women back from pursuing educational opportunities. It also limits their access to higher education. Despite almost 50 percent of the population being female, the literacy rate for women is abysmal.
Based on the initiative taken by Glow & Lovely (GAL) India, GAL Foundation is a scholarship program that allows women across Pakistan to compete for a chance to attend university on merit.

text For years, Dove, one of the biggest brands in our business, has acted on consumer demands for transparency, sustainability and purpose, setting out to reduce its impact on the natural world.
Dove moved to 100% recycled bottles in the US and Europe in 2019; it’s committed to a 50% reduction in virgin plastic by 2025; * has launched refillable and concentrated products; and is PETA-Approved.
Today, the brand announces the next step in this work – the Dove Nature Regeneration Project – an initiative in partnership with the Rimba Collective that will help protect and restore an area of forest eight times the size of Manhattan, while supporting local communities to thrive.
According to an IBM survey (PDF 1.49 MB) of more than 16,000 consumers across ten major markets, 77% said they wanted to make more sustainable choices at home and 51% said environmental sustainability was more important to them today than 12 months ago.
The business case for sustainability in consumer goods is clear. It’s the right choice for the planet, and for the 3.4 billion people who use our products every day.
Restoring nature, improving livelihoods
When it comes to looking after our planet, the importance of trees and rainforests can’t be overstated. Tropical rainforests cover around 8% of the world’s land surface and contain over half of Earth’s animal and plant species.
They are full of vivid and diverse beauty and play a practical role in climate change mitigation. By absorbing carbon dioxide (that would otherwise live in the atmosphere) and releasing oxygen, which we depend on for our survival, rainforests help stabilise the Earth’s climate.
Dove has made it clear that nature is at the heart of its business strategy.
Michal Zrust, CEO, Lestari Capital, the parent company of the Rimba Collective
From caring for your skin to caring for the Earth, the Dove Nature Regeneration Project forms part of a collective effort to protect rainforests and restore rainforest ecosystems, reaching 123,000 acres of land in Southeast Asia over the next five years.
Re-establishing forest cover is not only proven to reduce the impact of natural disasters such as flooding and landslides, it also protects precious biodiversity – in this case, critical habitats for approximately 80 endangered wildlife species such as the Sunda pangolin and the helmeted hornbill.
Dove is working with the Rimba Collective, a coalition of consumer goods businesses and agricultural growers, processors and traders. Partnering with NGOs, governments and conservation experts, the Collective has committed to deliver a positive impact on natural ecosystems at scale over the next 30 years by directly embedding forest conservation finance into supply chains.
Partnering with forest frontier communities
Led by local NGOs that have established track records of working with communities in forest frontier areas, the Rimba Collective will provide training and seed capital to promote the sustainable management of natural resources in the regions it reaches.
In doing so, it aims to improve the livelihoods of 8,000 local people, through job creation and increased access to education, healthcare, clean water and sanitation.
The project will also support livelihoods based on forest-friendly commodities by improving productivity, enhancing product quality and providing better market access for local communities.
“We will not stop reducing our impact”
“We are delighted to be collaborating with Dove on projects designed to create long-term positive impact for biodiversity, communities and the climate in Southeast Asia – areas we are deeply passionate about,” says Michal Zrust, CEO, Lestari Capital, the parent company of the Rimba Collective.
“Dove has made it clear that nature is at the heart of its business strategy. This is essential for changing the trajectory of the planet for the next generation, and I look forward to continuing our shared commitment to conservation long into the future.”
We need meaningful, decisive action to restore nature’s real beauty.
Firdaous El Honsali, Dove Global Vice President, External Communications and Sustainability 
“At Dove, we believe beauty should make our world more beautiful, not less. But the beauty of nature is under attack, and climate change remains one of the biggest threats we face. As a global brand used by millions, our scale demands that we act urgently to protect nature – and play a critical role in the effort to stop climate change,” explains Firdaous El Honsali, Dove Global Vice President, External Communications and Sustainability.
“If we don’t keep pushing for change, we will continue to see behaviour that drives deforestation, damages the land and soil we depend on, releases harmful carbon into our atmosphere, and pollutes the waterways that give us life. We need meaningful, decisive action to restore nature’s real beauty. The Dove Nature Regeneration Project is just one step we are taking as we strive to care for nature like we care for ourselves. We know our work is not done and we will not stop reducing our impact.”~

text How it started
Knorr’s success story started with lunch.
Or rather the search for appetising, quick and nutritious midday meals for workers in Carl Heinrich Knorr’s factory in Heilbronn Germany, which in 1838 was dedicated to supplying chicory to the coffee market.
Having identified this gap in the market, Carl Heinrich Knorr began to experiment with drying vegetables and spices in order to preserve both their nutritional content and their flavour.
By 1873 he was ready to share his culinary innovations with the world and the first Knorr dried soups began to be sold across continental Europe.
It was the beginning of a success story that would see the brand expand quickly, with a pre-cooked foods range introduced in 1885, followed by sauce mixes in 1908.
Then, in 1912, the bouillon cube was launched. It was a milestone moment, as this small square of flavour would quickly become the brand’s trademark product and a bestseller across the decades.
How it’s going
Today, Knorr is the world’s fifth-largest consumer packaged goods brand, enjoying year-on-year growth since 2020, thanks both to its retail division that accounts for 70% of the business and to a professional range of products that supports Unilever’s food service business, Unilever Food Solutions (UFS).
Knorr’s bouillon/stock cubes are undoubtedly drivers of this growth. With 600 cubes sold every minute, it is not surprising that they have become a staple in both home and professional kitchens all over the world.
And they are not alone. It is estimated that a Knorr product is chosen from the brand’s extensive range 3 billion times a year.
Now available in 95 countries globally, Knorr’s key markets are found in the US, Germany, Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Canada, France, South Africa, Poland, Pakistan, Thailand and China.
A leader across most of these markets, the key to Knorr’s international success lies in its ‘glocal’ (global/local) hybrid approach , which leverages the brand’s global food technologies into tailoring products to meet local and regional taste profiles.
The bouillon cube offers a great example. In addition to its core chicken cube, Knorr currently has over 180 active alternative chicken bouillon recipes on the market, each tailored to meet specific geographical taste preferences.
In Mexico, for example, chicken cubes are enhanced with the herbs and spices that are especially favoured in Latin American cooking. These include chicken and chipotle, and chicken and coriander/cilantro variations.
The brand takes a similar ‘glocal’ approach to serving consumer bases with specific dietary requirements. In the Netherlands, for instance, Knorr has launched a range of traditional, halal-certified soups such as Chorba and Harira in order to better serve the country’s significant Muslim community.
But it is not only geography that determines taste preferences. Generational differences can play a role too, which is why, for example, recent product launches and promotions have focused on meeting the needs of younger consumers.
In India, for example, K-Pots, a range of Asian-flavoured mini meals, were launched to satisfy a growing appetite among younger consumers for convenient snacking options.
Meanwhile, in Germany, Knorr’s award-winning Eat Your Veggies campaign, aimed at encouraging young people to eat more plant-based meals, leveraged the influencer power of seven TikTok creators who transformed the instructions for meat-free Knorr Fix recipe variations into songs.
The purpose that powers it
Making good food accessible to all has always been at the heart of Knorr’s operations. And thanks to its massive global reach and commitment to flavour, the brand is in a great position to promote healthy, sustainable eating in ways that are easy, affordable and, perhaps most importantly, appetising for everyone.
At Knorr we believe that good food can be easy, healthy and joyous. We’re leveraging the power of influencers and popular culture to make the good stuff irresistible.
Frank Haresnape, Knorr Global Vice President 
“Desirability and cravings shouldn’t be the domain of less good options. We’re leveraging the power of influencers and popular culture to make the good stuff irresistible.
“At Knorr we believe that good food can be easy, healthy and joyous,” says Frank Haresnape, Knorr’s Global Vice President.
To this end, Knorr is inspiring millions of people to cook healthier meals at home, not only through its products but also thanks to on-pack recipes, in-store promotions and on-the-ground nutrition initiatives and programmes at both a local and global level.
Here are a few examples:
1. Promoting plant-based eating
Many of Knorr’s campaigns champion plant-based meals by helping to make the swap from meat to veggies as simple as possible.
In France and Belgium, for example, the brand has recently launched a new range of seasoners specifically created to enhance the taste and texture of oven-baked vegetables.
The brand is also supporting plant-based eating through online recipe platforms which provide a wealth of vegetarian and vegan meal inspiration, and by replacing animal-based ingredients with plant-based alternatives in product recipes wherever possible.
2. Establishing a sustainable supply chain
For over ten years, Knorr has been working with suppliers and farmers in order to encourage and support them in growing key ingredients using the Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code.
Today 95% of vegetables and herbs are sustainably sourced, and Knorr is increasingly sourcing ingredients that are grown following regenerative agriculture principles.
3. Supporting good nutrition
Knorr’s commitment to supporting healthy nutrition is also reflected in a multitude of projects that target specific dietary issues. These include:
Fortification
For years, Knorr has been fortifying its products to help fight malnutrition. By the end of 2022, Knorr had delivered 131 billion fortified servingswith at least one of the five key micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin D, iodine, iron and zinc) in a total of 75 countries.
In Pakistan, for example, more than 50% of children under five and adolescent girIs are anaemic (NationaI Nutrition Survey 2018, Pakistan).
Knorr Iron + Masala Noodles, fortified with 15% of the recommended daily intake of iron as well as additional fibre, is addressing this problem by offering consumers a simple way to get a nutritious meal at a very affordable price point. By doing so, the brand is making nutritious and tasty meals available to people who need it most – especially in rural areas of the country.
Diversifying diets
Research has shown that a varied diet which includes plant-based foods is the best way to ensure good nutrition. To this end, Knorr has been working with communities across the globe to find easy, accessible ways to get healthy food onto the table.
In Indonesia, Royco’s (Knorr’s brand name in Indonesia) Nutrimenu education programme was launched in 2019 to help families adopt healthier eating habits by diversifying their diets.
By the end of 2022, its ‘What’s on my Plate’ campaign had helped people prepare 100 million more nutritious plates through on-ground and digital educational activities across Indonesia.
Brand new ideas
Product: salt-free bouillon 
As part of Unilever’s Future Foods commitment, Knorr is on a mission to reduce the salt content of its products. The challenge with bouillon cubes is that salt not only strengthens their flavour but also gives the cubes their structure.
However, in 2021, the Knorr R&D team cracked the problem: creating an alternative salt-free bouillon cube thanks to a unique blend of vegetables, herbs and spices which were used to help build up a rich umami flavour.
Campaign: Eat for Good
On 19 February 2021, Knorr launched World Eat for Good Day as a way of inspiring people to increase the nutritional value of their meals while decreasing the environmental impact of the food they put on their plates.
As part of this year’s events, the brand’s Dare to Try campaign challenged 11 influencers to a game of truth or dare during which they learnt the truth about sustainable food and dared to try alternative foods such as protein-rich insects.
The campaign secured 358 million reach in earned media outreach , ten years’ worth of content views and more than 7.9 billion views on TikTok. The campaign was also nominated for a Cannes Lions Creativity Award.
Packaging: Going green 
In 2021, Knorr’s packaging got a makeover that better reflected the brand’s 21st-century values and commitments.
The new look is unwaveringly green: a colour that reflects not only the brand’s commitment to healthy eating and sustainable food production but also its passion for natural freshness and flavour.

text A Corporate Collaboration to Advance Women’s Financial Inclusion in Pakistan
Guddi Baji, the female community influencer program is a livelihoods initiative which has been unlocking value and inclusion for women since 2012. From its first ever salon model in 2012, to its retail operations from 2015 to 2018, and now the 2019 partnerships with JazzCash and the Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN), more than 8000 women have been trained and enabled as entrepreneurs.
The new Guddi Baji model involves partnership with Pakistan’s largest telecommunications company, Jazz, through which both companies leveraged their core competencies to increase value for their products and drive financial inclusion for low-income women in Pakistan.
The Opportunity to Reach and Empower More Women
According to Women’s World Banking, only 7% of women in Pakistan maintain an account at a formal financial institution with the gender gap in account ownership increasing to 28 percentage points in recent years leaving over 50 million unbanked women who may actively save for their families through informal means. The JazzCash mobile wallet serving as a digital bank account helps women securely manage their finances.
Through our partnership with JazzCash, we are aiming to develop a network of JazzCash Guddi Baji retail agents who can offer access to financial services to their customers.
The Role of the Guddi Bajis and the 2019 Model:
We developed a partnership and consortium with a local social welfare organization – the Rural Support Program Network - to connect with the most vulnerable people in local communities. Through this platform, we have created an entrepreneurial movement whereby women in villages are given an opportunity to act as ambassadors and route-to-market agents for Unilever, providing a means of income for them to support their families. This model incorporates recruitment, training and capability building via comprehensive training tools, focusing on techniques to run profitable businesses.
In the 2019 model, 4500 Guddi Bajis were inducted from the rural areas across Pakistan. These women are not just agents for Unilever for door-to-door selling of our products and starting a retail business, they are also lady health care workers and RSPN workers who supply cosmetics, spices and other retail products on demand.
According to a survey, we found that over 40% of our Guddi Bajis now have smartphones and are using them with ease. This has opened avenues to place online orders through a digital ordering application for the Guddi Bajis which allows them direct booking of their orders. JazzCash has similarly helped them save and reinvest their money, enabling them to polish their entrepreneurial skills and achieve financial empowerment.
The Guddi Baji livelihoods program combines two of our priorities; improving livelihoods and women empowerment through financial inclusion enabling us to live our purpose of being a force for good for Pakistan and Pakistanis.

text Climate Action
We’re working to decarbonise our own business and wider value chain, and advocating for change beyond.
83%reduction in CO2 emissions (kg/tonne of production) Against 2018 baseline
78%Renewable Energy
8MWsolar generation (equivalent to planting 242,000 trees)
Unilever has pledged to become a 100% net-zero business by 2030, demonstrating that responsible business practices can coexist with profitability. Unilever Pakistan has already made significant strides towards this goal: 78 percent of its energy comes from renewable sources and solar energy equivalent to planting 242,000 trees has been generated.
Clean Energy Factories
Our factory in Rahim Yar Khan embodies Unilever's commitment to sustainability. 94 percent of its energy needs are met through green sources, including on-site solar and biomass generation. All of Unilever Pakistan's factories are making significant progress towards their clean energy targets. The company has also installed solar panels at non-manufacturing sites, resulting in substantial savings and exemplifying the benefits of renewable energy partnerships.

Waste free world
Transitioning to a circular economy is at the heart of our strategy for a waste-free world.
50%Plastic Neutral in 2022
60%Recyclable packaging
5000tonstonnes of plastic collected
Our commitment to sustainability includes addressing the issue of plastic waste. In 2022, we successfully recovered 50% of our plastic footprint, a total of 5,000 tonnes. 60 percent of our packaging is now recyclable. Since September 2022, all waste generated at our Head Office has been reused or recycled, fulfilling our zero-waste-to-landfill pledge.
We remain steadfast in our efforts to drive positive change and protect the planet for future generations.
Giving Plastics a Second Life
Pakistan produces 3.3 million tonnes of plastic waste every year. In recognition of this challenge, we have teamed up with Green Earth Recycling with the goal of gathering a greater quantity of plastic than we produce before 2025.
All the plastic waste collected will be integrated into the circular economy through various innovative solutions such as creating outdoor furniture items like benches, desks and children’s play areas. As of 2022, we have successfully recycled 36,000 kg of plastic and converted it into 20 sustainable play areas and benches which have been installed across Pakistan.
We remain committed to taking further steps toward achieving our vision for a sustainable future.
Waste-free Rahim Yar Khan
We are committed to creating a circular system for plastic waste management in the country. As part of our efforts, we have chosen Rahim Yar Khan as a pilot city to test new economic models aimed at influencing industrial and consumer behavior, policy shifts, and engaging private sector and non-traditional partners. Our goal is to transform Rahim Yar Khan into a plastic-free city and pave the way for a sustainable future in Pakistan.
Our goal is to transform Rahim Yar Khan into a model 'Plastic Waste Free' city in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) by 2025, with a projected 2,000 tonnes of plastics to be repurposed. Through such efforts, we aim to promote the circular economy for plastics and create park furniture using recycled plastic.
25% recycled bottle 
A new packaging innovation was introduced for Sunsilk Blackshine shampoo in 2022. Sunsilk Blackshine bottles would now incorporate 25 percent recycled plastic. Not only are these bottles 100 percent recyclable but they are made with locally sourced recycled plastic. This is a significant step towards rethinking our relationship with plastics and creating a sustainable future.
#FaceThePlastic
Launched in 2021, Unilever Pakistan’s #FaceThePlastic campaign has become a powerful movement in the company's ongoing efforts to reduce plastic waste. The campaign was developed in collaboration with vloggers and influencers. They played a key role in raising awareness about the urgent need for people to take action and address the issue of plastic waste. Through this initiative, we encourage people to make small but impactful changes in their daily lives that can help reduce plastic waste, such as using reusable bags, water bottles, and straws. Our goal is to inspire a broader cultural shift towards more sustainable consumption habits.
The Plastic Warrior Program 
Plastic Warrior Program invites volunteers from all age groups, industries, and academia to join the fight against plastic waste. To promote this initiative, Unilever Pakistan has partnered with NED University of Engineering and Technology to provide practical research projects at the student level. The Plastic Warrior Program has already produced exciting results: the first four student groups are aiding Unilever Pakistan’s in researching recycled plastic for their shampoo bottles. Additionally, the Plastic Warrior Program is working to make NED University a plastic waste-free campus, further reducing Pakistan’s plastic footprint.
Protect and Regenerate Nature
If we want a healthy planet, we must look after nature and the livelihoods it supports.​

text March 08, 2021: Today, Lifebuoy Shampoo has announced its partnership with the Ministry of Human Rights with TumMazbootHo – a campaign that aims to inspire women to raise stronger daughters for Pakistan, while empowering them to take a stand against domestic violence.
Launched on International Women’s Day, Lifebuoy Shampoo’s campaign with the Ministry of Human Rights, showcases the strength of bond that mothers share with daughters and highlights the influence of education in protecting future generations of girls from vulnerability.
The message created by Lifebuoy is a powerful insight into the mind of a young girl who observes the suffering of her mother and understands that she can rise above such circumstances through an education. The film ends with awareness about the Ministry of Human Right’s helpline for people to seek help against domestic abuse. With this campaign, Pakistan’s largest haircare brand, Lifebuoy Shampoo, builds on its long-running efforts to educate, enable, and empower girls across the nation.
Dr. Shireen Mazari, Federal Minister of Human Rights for Pakistan, shared her remarks on the partnership, “Every woman has a right to safety and a life free of violence. To support women facing domestic violence, the Ministry of Human Rights has launched a free, nationwide helpline 1099 to seek help against domestic abuse. Through our partnership with Unilever Pakistan, we hope that our efforts reach to a widespread audience and help millions of young girls who dream of a safe and equal future.”
Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan, said, “Domestic violence is a reality that millions of women face, and are increasingly vulnerable to in the post-COVID world. Our commitment in partnership with the Ministry of Human Rights is to ensure a world in which young women are raised to challenge and change this truth, and not conditioned to accept it. As a part of our corporate social responsibility, and vision to stand as #UnileverForPakistan, it is my hope that through this message, Lifebuoy Shampoo continues to inspire Pakistanis to become advocates for an equal and empowered Pakistan.”
Asima Haq, Director, Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever Pakistan, expressed her dedication to the cause, stating, “I feel that brands have the power to drive a positive change in society. I feel it is deeply important for us to use our voice and platform to help create a positive future for one entire half of our country’s population. Lifebuoy Shampoo’s message of strength and ‘Mazbooti’ aspires towards raising stronger daughters for Pakistan, and this promise has enabled over 10,000 young girls enroll into schools over the last two years. With this campaign, we want women to strengthen their daughters through education, and find the support they need for their own wellbeing.”
Lifebuoy Shampoo encourages people across the country to stand for their rights and progress with the “TumMazbootHo” message.

text June 3, 2021 - Unilever Pakistan and Green Earth Recycling Pakistan have announced their efforts to collect and repurpose plastic waste into sustainable furniture. Green Earth Recycling’s business model is based on converting plastic waste into useful “recycled plastic furniture” giving the plastic a second life, through a successful combination of material and technology. The company’s sustainably made furniture is resistant to natural damage and helps save trees while reduce solid plastic waste.
This partnership with Green Earth Recycling paves the next step of the company’s efforts to collect more plastic than it produces. Unilever Pakistan has also recently announced projects for a model city in Rahim Yar Khan, as well as brand led initiatives on sustainable plastic reuse. These collaborations are part of Unilever Pakistan’s larger vision on environment action in line with its contribution to the global Plastics commitments set by Unilever to cut down its use of virgin plastic, use reusable and recyclable plastic packaging and especially, collect and process more plastic than it sells.
With Green Earth Recycling, Unilever Pakistan will work to recover around 2,000 tonnes of plastic waste in 2021 and re-introduce it into the circular economy. The collected plastic is being recycled to create benches, desks, play areas and other outdoor furniture that can be used in parks and schools for the benefit of citizens. Through the partnership and the project, Unilever Pakistan is investing in models that not only help in creating a circular economy, but also drive economic empowerment and livelihood opportunities for people.
Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan expressed his ambition with the partnership, “We are fully committed towards stepping up our contribution in the circular economy through bold, consistent and rigorous action against our plastics ambitions to collect more plastic than we produce and make our packaging material sustainable. We believe that with this partnership with Green Earth Recycling, we are establishing a value chain where plastic waste can be collected, reused and built into environment and user-friendly solutions for citizens.”
Mr. Babar Aziz Bhatti, Director at Green Earth Recycling, also shared his views on the partnership, “We are working on creating innovative sustainable materials that reduce the negative impact of plastics on the environment and drive down dependence on natural resources such as wood. Our efforts with Unilever Pakistan will help us scale the impact of our business model and help us reach a wider audience, as real action across the country can only be driven through a focused effort with a collaborative approach amongst the public, private and social sectors.”
Unilever Pakistan and Green Earth Recycling have signed off on a pilot to recover 2,000 tonnes, with escalated targets over the continued course of the partnership. The recycled furniture will be used in public spaces and schools for the benefit of the people of Pakistan.

text Islamabad, 7 December 2020— UNDP Pakistan and Unilever Pakistan announced their partnership today to test solutions in an effort to minimize plastic waste in Rahim Yar Khan city.
Through this partnership, Unilever and UNDP will work together to enable the plastic waste management ecosystem in Rahim Yar Khan. This initiative will test solutions to reduce plastic waste, and potentially turn waste into resource. The key goal is to create a circular economy system for plastics waste management in Pakistan— by testing new economic models, industrial, and consumer behavior, policy shift and, engaging private sector, and other non-traditional partners.
A virtual event was held today to commemorate this partnership. Present at the event were Ms. Aliona Niculita, Resident Representative a.i., UNDP Pakistan; Mr. Amanullah Khan, Assistant Resident Representative, and Head of Environment and Climate Change Unit (ECCU), UNDP Pakistan; and Mr. Amir Paracha, CEO Unilever Pakistan Ltd, along with relevant representatives of UNDP Pakistan, Unilever Pakistan Ltd, and local government of Rahim Yar Khan City.
Rahim Yar Khan city is home to Unilever’s first and largest factory in Pakistan, and is of key strategic importance to the company’s national footprint. Unilever recently announced a multipronged ambition to reduce its plastic footprint and to play its role towards a circular economy. The company has pledged to collect more plastic than it sells as part of its environmental responsibility.
This vision is also inline of UNDP’s global commitment to work with governments worldwide on business solutions for waste management. UNDP Pakistan is part of the regional cohort of five Countries (Pakistan, Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Philippines) that are working on the challenge of plastic waste management with the Regional Innovation Center in Bangkok. UNDP is also a regional partner to Unilever, and has been actively engaging with the company on its plastics waste management agenda.
“UNDP is committed to promote public private partnership through innovative solutions to tackle complex development challenges,” stated Ms. Aliona Niculita, Resident Representative a.i. UNDP Pakistan. “UNDP’s plastic waste management portfolio is building a movement towards creating a circular economy for plastics in Pakistan. Through our partnership with Unilever Pakistan, we are working on creating innovative business solutions to turn waste into resource.”
Amir Paracha, Chairman & CEO, Unilever Pakistan added “Unilever has been a part of Pakistan since 1948, and we started that journey in the city of Rahim Yar Khan seven decades ago. This initiative is a means of giving back to our home city and to provide an economic model that can then be replicated across our country. We are confident that this partnership will identify a solution that will not only reduce plastic waste but also provide an opportunity for livelihoods to thousands of people across the country.”
The results from testing these solutions will provide field-tested and holistic insights on effective solutions to develop a larger programme and policy on plastic waste and circular economy.

text Today Lifebuoy, the world’s number one selling hygiene soap brand , announced a new partnership with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Pakistan Men’s National Cricket Team for their Test and IT2I Series against England. Pakistan started their opening Test Match against England Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester on Wednesday, and the team will travel to The Ageas Bowl, Southampton next week, for the second and third Test Matches. Both teams will then return to Manchester for three IT20s, finishing on Tuesday 1st September.
As Lifebuoy did in its recent partnership with the West Indies, the brand will be capturing content with the Pakistan squad to help promote better health through hygiene. The main objective of the content will be to share education on the importance of washing hands and practicing good hand hygiene to help keep everyone safe and help reduce the spread of infection’ Lifebuoy will also be supporting the Pakistan team by providing hand hygiene products to the full touring party.
Kartik Chandrasekhar, Global Vice President of Lifebuoy, said: “Lifebuoy has always been a brand that has looked to support people to have better personal hygiene. Following the success of our relationship with the West Indies, we are very excited to be partnering with Pakistan, a team steeped in heritage and a key market for Lifebuoy. Sports is an integral part of life, a passion point across countries that brings people together. We’re looking forward to working closely with the Pakistan cricket team to promote better hygiene practices. ”
Babar Hamid, Commercial Director at Pakistan Cricket Board said, “We are delighted to partner with Lifebuoy as our Official Hygiene Partner for the tour of England. Under the newly revamped commercial strategy, Pakistan Cricket Board is keen to create sustainable and meaningful partnerships with leading brands and this partnership with Lifebuoy is a key milestone in our strategy. The tour of England is happening under very different circumstances and in a world that requires us to place a renewed focus on health and safety. Our objective, through this partnership, is to use the Pakistan Men’s National Cricket Team’s outreach in order to influence attitudes towards hygiene and contribute towards a safer Pakistan for all of us.”
Pakistan’s Tour of England 2020 consists of a three-match Test Series and a three-match International T20 Series, both played behind closed doors.

text Underlying sales were flat with volume growth of 0.2% and negative price of 0.2%
Developed markets underlying sales growth was 2.8% and emerging markets declined 1.8%
Turnover increased 0.2% including a positive impact of 0.6% from acquisitions net of disposals and negative impact of 0.4% from currency
Quarterly dividend maintained at €0.4104 per share
A statement from CEO Alan Jope
“Covid-19 is having an unprecedented impact on people and economies worldwide. Unilever has moved at speed to support our multiple stakeholders and maintain our operations through the crisis, and prepare for growth in a new normal. We have structured our immediate response into five areas: supporting our people; protecting supply; serving demand; contributing to society; and maintaining our financial strength.
Our people are our priority and we moved quickly to ensure the safety of our workforce as well as to protect incomes and jobs. We are now focused on redeploying people to those parts of the business that are seeing high demand.
We have been able to maintain the supply of product and we are keeping our factories running through the many unpredictable challenges in local operating environments across our value chain. We are also opening up new capacity where it is most needed, such as in hand hygiene and food.
Demand patterns are changing. As the crisis hits countries around the world, we see upswings in sales of hygiene and in-home food products, combined with some household stocking, and near cessation of out of home consumption which is particularly affecting our food service and ice cream business. We are adapting to new demand patterns and are preparing for lasting changes in consumer behaviour, in each country, as we move out of the crisis and into recovery.
The crisis highlights the importance of our commitment to use our scale and brands as a force for good in society, throughout the pandemic and beyond. We are supporting communities through donations and partnerships, while our Lifebuoy and Domestos brands are leading the way on hygiene education programmes.
We take these actions in the knowledge that we enter the crisis with a strong balance sheet and cash position. We are systematically reviewing all areas of cash generation and usage and re-evaluating all costs in the light of the current circumstances, so that we can continue to invest in our brands and reallocate funds towards the best opportunities.
We will continue to adapt throughout this crisis. However, the unknown severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the containment measures that may be adopted in each country, mean that we cannot reliably assess the impact across our markets and our business. We are therefore withdrawing our previous growth and margin outlook for 2020.
Our portfolio, our financial stability and the quality of our leadership teams around the world mean that Unilever is well-positioned during this crisis and for the changing world that will come afterwards. The fundamental drivers of growth continue to be the key principles driving our execution as we remain focused on delivering superior long-term financial performance through our sustainable business model.”
Our markets
The spread of Covid-19 has led to extensive changes in the operating environment in our markets. The lock-downs and restrictions that have been implemented in many countries have varied in severity, but all have had some impact on consumer demand patterns and many have also had a significant impact on the supply of goods.
At an individual market level, most lock-downs have required closures in out of home channels, resulting in little out of home consumption of ice cream and food. Initial household stocking of both hygiene and food products has led to increased volume in some markets.
Most major markets, outside China, saw normal sales patterns in January and February with Covid-19 impacting in March. The Chinese market slowed significantly during the lock-down period, which began in January, whilst Europe and North America, saw a positive impact of household stocking in March. The Indian market had slowed even before the strict lock-down began at the end of March. Conditions in Latin America remain challenging, as they were before Covid-19, although we have seen some household stocking at the end of the quarter.
Unilever overall performance
Underlying sales growth was 0.0% with 0.2% from volume and negative 0.2% from price. Developed markets grew 2.8% whilst emerging markets declined 1.8%. China declined as a result of the downturn in food service, out of home ice cream and retail sales during the lock-down. Growth in India was impacted by both the slowing market and the lock-down implemented at the end of March, which stopped production and shipping for a number of days. Latin America grew 4.9% whilst South East Asia was mixed, following the introduction of strict restrictions in the Philippines. North America and Europe benefitted from household stocking, despite a decline in food service and ice cream. E-commerce grew as shoppers moved from offline to online channels.
Turnover increased 0.2%. There was a positive impact of 0.6% from acquisitions net of disposals and a negative impact of 0.4% from currency.
Covid-19 support measures
During the quarter Unilever introduced a wide-ranging set of measures to support global and national efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. We are contributing €100 million through donations of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food as well as leveraging our procurement network to acquire much-needed medical equipment for organisations around the world.
Strict protocols for hygiene and physical distancing have been put in place for Unilever’s sourcing units and distribution centres, and all Unilever office-based employees have been working from home. Unilever has also committed to protect its workforce in the short-term from sudden drops in pay, as a result of market disruption or being unable to perform their role.
We are making available €500 million of cash flow relief for our most vulnerable small and medium sized suppliers and small-scale retail customers whose business relies on Unilever.
In addition, we are working with the UK’s Department for International Development to fund a global programme to urgently tackle the spread of coronavirus. The programme aims to reach up to a billion people worldwide, raising hygiene awareness and changing behaviour.
Recent acquisitions
On 1 April 2020, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Unilever’s listed subsidiary in India, successfully completed the merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited. The transaction is in line with Unilever’s strategy to evolve the Foods & Refreshment portfolio into higher growth segments. In early April we also entered into agreements to buy out the minority shareholders of our subsidiary in Malaysia.
Beauty & Personal Care
Beauty & Personal Care underlying sales grew 0.3%, with volume growth of 0.7% and negative pricing of 0.5%. Growth in key categories was driven by both consumption and household stocking.
Skin cleansing saw mid-single digit volume-led growth as we responded to the critical need for hygiene products to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Through our Lifebuoy hygiene brand we continued to raise handwashing awareness, introducing lifebuoy products to 43 new markets, as well as working quickly across brands to expand our range of formats to support the pandemic response.
Skin care declined, as travel restrictions impacted the Carver portfolio and India was impacted by lock-down conditions. Vaseline continued to perform well, with mid-single digit growth, and we launched anti-bacterial hand cream in the UK as well as a new Pro Derma Clinical range in China. The Prestige portfolio was impacted by health and beauty channel closures in many markets.
Whilst hair grew in the US, the lock-down impacted the portfolio in China and in India. Deodorants grew mid-single digit, with strong performances from our Rexona Clinical range and Dove deodorants. Oral care grew, with growth from natural toothpastes and bamboo toothbrushes. Negative pricing was primarily driven by India following price reductions in the previous quarter.
Home Care
Home Care underlying sales grew 2.4%, with 2.6% from volume and negative price of 0.2%.
Our home and hygiene brands, including Cif surface cleaners and Domestos bleach, benefitted from increased demand for household cleaning products, with double digit underlying sales growth. In China, we accelerated the launch of the new germ-killing Botanical Hygiene range, addressing demand for natural cleaning supported by advanced and effective technology.
Format premiumisation continues to be a driver of volume-led growth in fabric solutions, with liquids and capsules both growing double digits. Clean and green home care brand Seventh Generation also saw double digit growth.
Foods & Refreshment
Foods & Refreshment underlying sales declined 1.7%, with volumes down 1.8% and positive pricing of 0.1%.
The largest volume decline was in ice cream, as the seasonal sell-in for out of home consumption in key markets such as Europe, Turkey and Latin America were heavily impacted by lock-down measures and the reluctance of distributors to commit to buying ice cream stock with an uncertain holiday and tourism season.
There was also a sharp decline in food service, as restaurants in China and elsewhere closed due to Covid-19 mitigation measures. This was offset by increased in-home consumption and household stocking in some markets, particularly the US and Europe, leading to volume-led growth in savoury and dressings. Knorr saw low single digit growth, while Hellmann’s grew double digits as our brands helped to feed the many families at home.
Tea declined low-single digit, impacted by India and out of home channel closures. The strategic review of our tea business is ongoing.

text Karachi, 19 January 2021:
Lifebuoy has become the official hygiene partner of the Pakistan men’s national cricket team with the announcement of a one-year agreement at the National Stadium Karachi on Tuesday (today).
As a result of this historic agreement, the PCB and Lifebuoy will partner for Pakistan men’s team’s home assignments during the one-year period and for year-long content and activations aimed at enhancing awareness around hygiene.
During the agreement period, Pakistan will host South Africa, England, New Zealand and the West Indies in what promises to be a thrilling and exciting year for international cricket in the country.
PCB Director Commercial Babar Hamid and Director Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever Pakistan Asima Haq were present at the announcement event held at the National Stadium Karachi today.
The venue will host the first Pakistan-South Africa Test which starts from January 26 on what is the first visit by the Proteas to Pakistan in more than 13 years.
Previously, the PCB and Lifebuoy had partnered successfully on a short-term basis with exciting content creation aimed at enhancing hygiene awareness. The success of that campaign during the team’s tour of England has now translated into a year-long partnership between the two.
Director Commercial Babar Hamid: “We are now further strengthening our ties with Lifebuoy following the successful campaign last year during Pakistan men’s national cricket team’s tour of England.
“Over the course of the next 12 months, Pakistan is set to host top-class international cricket besides the ongoing historic trip from South Africa. England, West Indies and New Zealand are all scheduled to visit the country for what promises to be an extremely exciting year of cricket that will capture the imagination of the nation.
“This partnership will be a great boost to both Lifebuoy and PCB and we are together looking forward to a great year.”
Director Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever Pakistan Asima Haq: “Covid-19 has reaffirmed the importance of hygiene for our health and wellbeing. Lifebuoy, since its inception has stood for preventing infections and saving lives through hand washing.
“In line with this mission of promoting good hand hygiene, we are partnering with the Pakistan Cricket Board to ensure that both clean hands and cricket can remain an integral part of the lives of Pakistanis. Together, we aim to create awareness on good hygiene behaviours.”

text Karachi, 25 June 2020: Unilever Pakistan announced today the next step in the evolution of its skin care portfolio, with the rebranding of its flagship brand Fair & Lovely. Taking forward the brand’s journey towards a more inclusive vision of beauty, the company will stop using the word ‘Fair’ in the brand name ‘Fair & Lovely’. The new name of Fair & Lovely will be announced after the necessary regulatory approval.
Over the last decade, Fair & Lovely’s advertising has evolved to communicate a message of women empowerment. The brand’s vision is to adopt a holistic approach to beauty that cares for people and that is inclusive and diverse - for everyone, everywhere. The brand is committed to celebrating all skin tones.
In 2019, the brand’s communication moved away from benefits of fairness, whitening and skin lightening, towards glow, even tone, skin clarity and radiance which are holistic measures of healthy skin. Unilever Pakistan has also removed all visuals or words on Fair & Lovely’s packaging that could indicate a fairness-led transformation – including the removal of dual-faced cameo showing shade transformation, as well as the shade guides. Unilever Pakistan upholds principles that no association should be made between skin tone and a person’s achievement, potential or worth.
Amir Paracha, Chairman & CEO, Unilever Pakistan Limited, said, “Unilever is an organization that is evolving continuously, and today we have taken the next bold step in our evolution by committing to a more inclusive and diverse portrayal of beauty. This ambition has been in the works for some time with significant steps such as the removal of the dual-faced cameo and shade guides from the packaging of Fair & Lovely in 2019.
We have also moved the brand communication away from fairness towards glow which is a more holistic and inclusive measure of healthy skin. We are now committing to remove the word ‘Fair’ from the brand formerly known as 'Fair & Lovely'. The new name will be announced soon.”
Fair & Lovely is based on pioneering technology that has made multiple skin health benefits available to millions of consumers at an affordable price. Fair & Lovely has a combination of vitamins B3, B6, C & E, glycerine, UVA and UVB sunscreens and allantoin - which together are known to improve skin health and protect the skin from external aggressors, UV rays and environmental pollution. The product is designed to improve skin barrier function, improve skin firmness and smoothen skin texture - all of which help enhance radiance and glow holistically.
In addition to the changes to Fair & Lovely, the rest of our skincare portfolio will also reflect the new vision of positive beauty.

text Unilever Pakistan has announced its partnership with K-Solar, a subsidiary of KE, to transition its operations to solar energy in Rahim Yar Khan and Karachi. This initiative represents a significant step towards achieving Unilever's ambitious sustainability goals, including net zero emissions in its operations by 2039. Simultaneously, the firm will shed close to PKR 84 million a year in energy costs, facilitating the local economy by considerably reducing the strain on the national grid collectively generating approx. 2.3 million Kwh through renewable sources.
Unilever Pakistan's Solar Captive Power Plant Phase 2 installation demonstrates their dedication to renewable energy solutions, leading to significant savings and CO2 reductions. At Futehally Chemicals Limited (FCL), the factory that manufactures Surf Excel for Unilever, the 362 kW system will save 496,035 kWh annually, reducing costs by approximately 18 million PKR and CO2 emissions by 233 metric tons.
The 1000 kW installation at Rahim Yar Khan Factory will save 1,430,886 kWh, saving approximately 53 million PKR and a CO2 reduction of 662 metric tons per year. The 250 kW system at Rahim Yar Khan Estate will save 357,721 kWh, resulting in cost savings of 13 million PKR and a CO2 reduction of 165 metric tons annually. Unilever Pakistan's investment in these projects reinforces their commitment to sustainability.
While Unilever's own factories, offices, research labs, data centers, warehouses, and distribution centers account for only 2% of its total greenhouse gas footprint, the company acknowledges the significance of these emissions and is committed to eliminating them entirely.
Abdul Hannan Ahmed Khan, Head of Supply Chain at Unilever Pakistan, expressed his enthusiasm for this collaboration, stating, "Unilever Pakistan is deeply committed to sustainable practices and minimizing our impact on the environment. This solar project is a testament to our dedication to combat climate change and create a brighter, cleaner future. By investing in renewable energy, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions but also driving positive change in the communities we operate in."
Hashim Raza, CEO of K-Solar, emphasized the significance of joint efforts in realizing a sustainable energy future. He stated, "We are thrilled to partner with Unilever Pakistan on this journey. By combining Unilever's leadership in sustainability and K-Solar's expertise in renewable energy solutions, we are confident that we can make a substantial impact in reducing carbon emissions and promoting the use of clean energy sources."
Unilever has been at the forefront of climate action for decades, consistently working towards reducing its carbon footprint. Recognizing the urgent need to eliminate fossil fuels entirely and transition to renewable energy sources, Unilever Pakistan has been well on its way with its proactive approach to address its greenhouse gas emissions.

text Extreme weather caused by climate change is already lowering crop yields and increasing water scarcity. And it risks disrupting supply chains and raising the price of raw materials.
Without a healthy planet, you can’t have a healthy business. Making the shift to sustainability makes business sense, giving companies a chance to help address the root causes of climate change while simultaneously building their own resilience to its impacts and delivering competitive growth.
Business sustainability is when a company conducts its business without harming people or planet, safeguarding its future business in the process.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting nature and delivering social governance are all ways that businesses can make the shift towards sustainability.
Unilever’s purpose is to make sustainability commonplace, through our business model, the products we sell and the influence we have on wider society. We also believe that a truly sustainable business doesn’t just focus on limiting negative impacts: companies should also aim to create positive impacts where possible. By protecting and regenerating nature, for example, businesses are not only reducing emissions and bringing back biodiversity, they can also support local communities by encouraging smallholder farmers to use better farming practices that benefit people and planet.
What are the benefits of a sustainable business model?
Sustainable businesses are future-fit. Companies that embrace sustainability are showing leadership in tackling climate change and getting ahead of the curve of carbon taxes. They are working to meet consumer demands, while boosting productivity and potentially cutting costs.
Here are four ways a sustainable business model can equal economic growth.
Leading the charge
Smart companies are recognising the opportunities presented to early adopters of business sustainability. A 2023 report by Deloitte (Opens in a pop-up window ) showed 84% of business leaders agree that global economic growth can be achieved while also reaching climate change goals and 75% say their organisations have increased their sustainability investments over the past year, indicating a likely groundswell of action within industry.
Companies making the shift to a sustainable business model now have a chance to mark themselves out as leaders in the field, rather than risk being left behind.
Meeting consumer demand
Customers today expect transparency, responsibility and action from the brands and companies they buy from. According to Kantar’s Who Cares, Who Does (Opens in a pop-up window ) 2023 report, 22% of households are actively making more sustainable buying decisions and ‘eco-active’ people are worth an estimated $456 billion (€426 billion) to the fast-moving consumer goods industry.
Creating operational efficiency
Becoming more sustainable usually demands that businesses significantly change their manufacturing processes, supply chains and other aspects of their business model. The actions undertaken, such as switching to cleaner and smarter energy, saving water and reducing journeys travelled, can also lead to greater efficiency.
Research by McKinsey and Co (Opens in a pop-up window ) found that executing new policies to tackle resource efficiencies could, in certain cases, positively affect a business’s operating profits by up to 60%. At Unilever, we have avoided costs of around €1.5 billion from our energy and water efficiency measures since 2008.
Creating growth through purpose 
There’s clear evidence to suggest that being purposeful can help companies attain growth, while also serving as a future-minded sustainable business strategy. A study from Kantar (Opens in a pop-up window ) found that purpose-driven businesses grew by 175% between 2008 and 2020, compared to just 70% growth for low-purpose brands.
The Unilever Compass (PDF 501.03 KB) is designed to support growth, to align all our products with clear environmental and social benefits, and to help make sustainable living easier and commonplace for everyone.
Why we’re collaborating to create change
For many companies, Unilever included, a large part of our environmental footprint is generated outside our own operations, so working in isolation will not help reduce our impact at scale. But through strategic partnerships, we can accelerate the change that is needed to shift to sustainability and provide greater economic certainty for us all.
Unilever is working with a vast range of stakeholders to help protect and restore biodiversity and tackle climate change, from jurisdictional landscape projects taking practical action on the ground, to our Supplier Climate Programme helping suppliers who contribute most to our footprint to move forward with their climate journeys.
We also work in coalition with international forums such as the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders which advocates ambitious action on climate change across the private sector, and we are appealing for project developers, co-funders and innovators to partner with us to accelerate solutions through Unilever’s Climate & Nature Fund.

text When a laundry or dishwashing product is used, the detergent that goes into the drain breaks down and greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere.
The only way to eliminate these emissions is to make the product’s ingredients from renewable sources, rather than from fossil fuels.
While this is technically feasible and provides the same performance for consumers, it is still an emerging industry. So the supply of more sustainable ingredients needs to increase and costs need to come down before it can become adopted at scale.
The sector-wide shifts that are required are outlined in a new report by the University of Oxford, in partnership with Unilever, called Cleaning up Cleaning: Policy and stakeholder interventions to put household formulations on a pathway to net zero (PDF 2.57 MB) (Opens in a pop-up window ).
The report – which launches today at a roundtable meeting during Climate Week NYC – identifies opportunities to address the emissions released after use, focusing on the fossil-based carbon found in everyday cleaning products such as laundry powder and liquid, hand and machine dishwashing detergent and bars.
In these products, the carbon used to make the ingredients known as surfactants – which make up to 80% of the carbon present – is largely derived from the petrochemical industry.
If this sector is to move to net zero, these will need to be replaced by sustainable carbon from renewable or recycled sources.
But this transition is unlikely to occur at the pace required to address climate change in a manner aligned with keeping global temperatures to 1.5 degrees unless there is government policy intervention. This is because bio-based chemicals are currently more expensive than their fossil-based counterparts and there is little incentive for any single company to voluntarily switch, as this would put it at a competitive disadvantage.
As such, the main recommendation of the report is for policymakers to work with stakeholders from across industry, civil society, the financial community, researchers and consumers to create national strategies to increase the use of sustainable carbon as feedstock (raw material used for processing or manufacturing) for these products.
Overall, nearly 60% of our greenhouse gas emissions within the scope of Unilever’s net zero target come from the raw materials and ingredients we buy, and finding alternatives to fossil-fuel-based chemicals is going to be our biggest challenge in reaching net zero by 2039.
To achieve this, we’re working with supplier partners to radically reduce the GHG impact of our scope 3 emissions. The latest example of this is our India business collaborating with leading chemical companies TFL and OCI to pilot the production of near-zero emissions synthetic soda ash – a key ingredient in laundry powder.
As Rebecca Marmot, Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “We are fully committed to achieving net zero, which means we need to continue to address our scope 3 emissions. But in order to do this, we need our supply chain to accelerate its shift to ingredients with renewable feedstocks.
We are fully committed to achieving net zero, which means we need to continue to address our scope 3 emissions.
Rebecca Marmot, Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer.
“Addressing scope 3, or supply-chain GHG emissions, is a challenge the entire industry is facing. But by working together, we can accelerate progress and find solutions that benefit consumers and industry, yet still deliver the GHG emission reduction that is needed.”
Since the ingredients we use are responsible for the biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions across the lifecycle of our home care brands, this shift is at the heart of our Clean Future strategy. Here are just a few other ways we’re already working with partners to develop alternatives.
Building a clean green foam-production machine
We have been working with world-leading chemical specialists Evonik for several years now, looking to develop the use of rhamnolipids – a high-performance biosurfactant made using sugar as its main raw material. The biosurfactant has great potential to help reduce the cleaning industry’s carbon impact as it’s fully biodegradable with a low-impact life-cycle.
When we started using this revolutionary sustainable foaming agent in our Quix hand dishwash liquid in 2019, it was a world first. Now, working in partnership with Evonik, we are taking this pioneering green ingredient global.
Scaling plant-based alternatives to feedstocks like palm oil
Alongside Genomatica, a leader in biotech and sustainability, last year we launched a venture to scale and commercialise alternatives to palm oil and fossil fuel-derived cleansing ingredients. With growing demand for sustainably-sourced palm oil, this venture aims to deliver additional responsibly sourced palm oil alternatives to the market at a competitive cost.
The innovation is particularly relevant to cleaning and personal care products that require ingredients to lather and lift dirt. But at present, there are few viable and affordable alternatives to palm and fossil sources that can be produced at scale in order to make those ingredients.
Creating a plant-based hand dishwash that’s three times more renewable
In 2021, we launched a hand dishwash product made with an alternative to fossil-fuel derived surfactants that’s not only made using renewable ingredients but also offers the same – if not better – cleaning performance. The formulation is three times more renewable and 99% biodegradable, using 100% plant-derived ingredients.
The launch of this new formulation marked another significant step forward in our Clean Future journey as it provided us with the base into which we can incorporate future technologies such as rhamnolipids.

text Côte d’Ivoire is the world’s biggest cocoa producer, exporting 1.5 million tonnes every year 1. Farming cocoa beans plays a vital role in the region’s economy, contributing 15% of the country’s GDP and employing one-quarter of the population 2.
But agricultural expansion has not been without cost, causing 25% of the country’s primary forest cover to disappear between 2002 and 2019 3.
Cocoa farmers’ pay has not reflected their product’s popularity. Millions of these farmers don’t earn a living income and, on average, earn just 6% of the final value of a chocolate bar. 
As a cocoa buyer, Unilever wants to help redress the balance. That’s why we’re working with partners on the ground, supporting agroforestry programmes that empower farmers to use better farming practices that benefit people and planet.
Boosting cocoa supplies by planting trees
Our integrated agroforestry approach helps to restore degraded land, improves forest cover and promotes sustainable agriculture. It also increases farmers’ awareness of the challenges posed by deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices.
The programme does this by providing tools that will help improve farmers’ livelihoods, such as training on climate-smart agricultural practices. It also helps communities to develop their own plant nurseries to cultivate tree seedlings, which the farmers then plant. They can choose which type of tree they want to plant, under guidance from our local implementation partners. Different species provide different benefits, from trees that help rebuild the forest canopy (shade trees) or restore soil through nitrogen provision (plants that produce peas, beans or lentils) to fruit trees that provide farmers with crops to eat or sell. Some also have cultural value to local communities (community and ancestor forests).
The benefits of agroforestry are wide-ranging. By supporting farmers to raise their income levels and diversify their crops, this kind of farming lessens the incentive for farmers to expand their farmland into forest areas. To ensure farmers have the right incentives to invest in their farms, we’re also supporting farmers to secure rights to their land.
We’ve also been mapping our direct cocoa supply chain, together with our suppliers, to improve traceability and better understand where our cocoa comes from. And 96% of the farm plots in our direct sourcing have already been mapped to date. These results will enable us to better define deforestation risk and to identify issues on the ground that require remediation.
Our combined approach to supporting smallholder livelihoods and embedding sustainable farming practices will ensure our suppliers – and therefore our business – have access to a sustainable supply of deforestation-free cocoa in line with our goal in the Unilever Compass. At Unilever, we’re working towards a future where deforestation-free is the only way we operate.
Building resilience and supporting farmers
Megan Willis, Head of Sustainable Sourcing, Living Income and Nature, explains. “Ensuring we have a sustainable and deforestation-free supply chain means not just protecting the environment, but also supporting farmers to strengthen their livelihoods and continue looking after the land they work with,” she says.
Agroforestry is an important part of our approach to cocoa sourcing that will help Unilever build a more resilient cocoa supply chain, while benefiting smallholder farmers and nature.
Megan Willis, Head of Sustainable Sourcing, Living Income and Nature
We launched our Cocoa Remediation Programme in Côte d’Ivoire in 2021 as part of our commitment to the Cocoa & Forests Initiative (CFI). Unilever is one of 37 signatories who are working alongside the CFI to help end deforestation and forest degradation in the cocoa supply chain, beginning in Côte d’Ivoire. The programme, which continues to grow every year, is expected to benefit 2,250 farmers in our supply chain and we are on track to meet our target to distribute 400,000 trees by end of 2023.

text How it started
Clear made its debut as a small anti-dandruff shampoo brand in Italy in 1975. Back then it was sold as Clinic, before re-launching as Clear in 1982 and reaching markets all over the world.
Specialising in scalp care technology developed by scientists at the Clear Institute in Paris, Clear became the first shampoo brand to address recurrent dandruff by treating the scalp.
The brand’s pioneering work to explore the difference between male and female scalp biology led to a new wave of customised solutions. Acting on the insight that men’s scalps produce 60% more sebum than women’s, Clear created targeted products to deliver rapid, long-lasting dandruff prevention, and dermatologists endorsed its results.
From the outset, Clear broke the mould for anti-dandruff shampoo advertising, standing out from competitors by featuring celebrities in commercials and focusing on resilience and results rather than the fear of flakes.
How it’s going
Clear has grown consistently for the past three years (post-pandemic) and is now the world’s No.1 male shampoo brand, * and the No.1 anti-dandruff shampoo in three of Unilever’s biggest haircare markets: South-East Asia, Brazil and Turkey.
Sold in more than 60 markets across the globe, Clear has evolved beyond dandruff removal to address holistic scalp problems. It’s an authority on all types of scalp care, with products in the range addressing a spectrum of consumer needs from deep cleansing, nourishment, itchy scalp and grease to sophisticated new treatments which help prevent hair fall from the roots.
Designed by scalp care experts, every product in the portfolio combines unbeatable dandruff performance with clinically proven scalp skincare technology to boost resilience against internal and external scalp aggressors.
As the first brand to introduce customised anti-dandruff solutions for men, Clear has been leading the expansion of the male shampoo category with strong results. The brand’s entire core men’s shampoo line is now enriched with sunflower seed oil and glycine, ingredients designed to strengthen men’s weaker scalp skin barrier and help prevent recurring dandruff.
Worldwide, Clear’s best-seller is the Clear Men Cool Sport Menthol shampoo, a product designed to remove, resist and prevent dandruff while providing a cooling sensation that keeps the hair and scalp feeling fresh.
And Cristiano Ronaldo, renowned as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has been a Clear spokesman for many years and collaborated with the brand to co-create the Clear Men Legend Shampoo by CR7 – a product advertised as the ‘best-ever Clear shampoo for men’.
The purpose that powers it
Growing social anxiety, especially performance anxiety, is affecting young people’s mental wellbeing all over the world. It impacts their stress levels, their confidence – and their scalp health.
That’s why Clear is a brand built on clear-head confidence – and its purpose is all about empowering people with a clear head and boosting their performance in life.
Recurring scalp problems are more than skin deep. They can worsen social anxiety, while daily stress may also trigger dandruff and scalp problems. It’s a cycle which Clear wants to empower everyone to break, so they can face anxiety head-on and perform at their best.
Clear’s approach goes beyond simply eliminating dandruff. Its formulas also focus on preventing its return, promoting a problem-free, fresh, resilient scalp.
The brand’s ads are a source of empowerment, not anxiety, recognising that stereotypes can contribute to feelings of anxiety and perpetuate negative self-perception. That’s why Clear’s communications don’t depict people embarrassed by their dandruff or scalp conditions. The conversation is more around taking action and feeling confident in Clear’s proven efficacy.
Clear has also partnered with the Resilience Research Centre since 2021 on its Clear Head Project – an initiative designed to empower young people who are navigating an epidemic of anxiety. The goal: equipping them with self-efficacy, enabling them to manage challenging emotions and, as a result, experience reduced dandruff.
Clear relaunched its purpose in China earlier this year with a music video starring pop singer and Clear ambassador Jackson Yi. The film received more than 200 million impressions and attracted engagement from over 1 million fans during a live-stream launch event.
Watch the video below.
Niacinamide-boosted anti-dandruff shampoo
Clear recently launched the first clinically proven anti-dandruff formula powered by niacinamide concentrate, delivering 100% protection against returning dandruff.
Clear’s core range has now been upgraded to include this key ingredient, inspired by functional skincare, to repair and strengthen the scalp’s skin barrier. In doing so, the scalp benefits from stronger protection against recurring dandruff so it’s not just using an anti-microbial to remove the flakes, it’s also providing longer-term results to keep dandruff at bay.
Backed by scientific trials, this new formula is proven to reduce dandruff return in 28 days.
Ultra performance formula for men
Engineered specifically for men, who tend to have a greasier, weaker scalp than women and usually wash their hair more often, Clear’s core Men’s range was formulated by Unilever scalp scientists to include a unique combination of potent and nourishing skincare ingredients.
Men’s more frequent hair washing typically removes vital nutrients from the scalp, leaving it at risk of dryness. Clear’s mix for men features glycine, sunflower seed oil and niacinamide as well as amino acids. Together this exclusive technology not only helps to remove flakes, but also soothes and strengthens men’s scalp protection against recurring dandruff.
Preventing hair fall from the scalp with proven results
With more than 50 years of research on hair and scalp biology, Clear is perfectly placed to help address hair fall by going beyond the strands. Instead, its solutions focus on the foundation of our hair: the scalp.
The brand’s new Clear Men Scalp Pro Anti Hair Fall and Clear Scalpceuticals Hair Fall Resist lines are the first Unilever haircare products to have a special cosmetics licence in China, meaning they meet extremely strict criteria in terms of efficacy and claims. The products are clinically proven to reduce hair fall from the scalp within 30 days. [ 1] First launched in China in August 2022, they have since reached Thailand, Turkey and Brazil in 2023, delivering differentiated scalp care with two powerful ingredients developed by Unilever scientists: DynoxidilTM and FollilockTM.
DynoxidilTM is a potent anti-hair fall technology which combines root strengthening zinc salt with an active follicle revitalisation ingredient: yeast peptides extract. By deeply penetrating hair follicles, it enhances follicle structural integrity for stronger root anchorage and delivers nourishment to follicle cells. It’s clinically proven to revitalise hair follicles and promote faster growing hair.
FollilockTM is an advanced, lab-derived and clinically proven anti-hair fall mixture that forms the foundation of a healthy scalp care routine. The scalp care ingredient (piroctone olamine) combined with root strengthening zinc salt in the shampoo not only strengthens the scalp barrier and encourages the healthy growth of hair, but also rebalances proteolytic activity [ 2], involved in hair shedding to help reduce excessive hair loss. When combined with DynoxidilTM, anti-hair fall benefits are enhanced. FollilockTM is clinically proven to effectively reduce hair fall after 30 days by strengthening hair anchorage to the scalp. [ 3]

text State-of-the-art laboratories, a pilot plant to put new ideas to the test, and an in-house hair salon with full-time stylists working with around 50 participants a week trying new products are just a taste of what you’ll find at Unilever’s R&D campus in Trumbull, Connecticut.
Nearly 400 scientists work at the site, conducting global R&D for skincare and haircare products for brands including SheaMoisture, Vaseline, Dove and Melé.
Since 2018, it’s also been home to Unilever’s Polycultural Centre of Excellence (PCOE), comprising a team of 50+ scientists specialising in skincare, skin cleansing and haircare.
An impact that goes beyond skin-deep
“While we know there are more than 1.5 billion consumers with melanin-rich skin and/or textured hair around the world, we also understand they have unmet needs in the beauty, care and wellness space,” explains Peter Schrooyen, Unilever’s Head of Beauty & Wellbeing R&D North America.
The 2020 US census shows that Black, Asian and Hispanic Americans now account for 37.3% of the population. A report published by the FDA in the same year indicates that when it comes to research and clinical trials, there is still work to be done to ensure they represent the diverse demographics they serve.
Currently, Asian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx individuals make up 6%, 8% and 11% of the clinical trial populations, respectively. Comparatively, white individuals make up 75%.
The PCOE was created to help address these knowledge gaps, bringing together a team from different R&D functions including formulation, consumer technical insights, and science & technology to work as part of the ‘Melanin Science Movement’ (MSM), a programme designed by Unilever to further develop the understanding of melanin and how it affects the skin.
That work has seen the PCOE’s R&D teams reach out beyond the science: “to partnerships with diverse experts and suppliers to understand how cultural preferences, habits and practices intertwine to create the consumers’ beauty experience,” Schrooyen says.
Using insights to deliver on under-represented consumer needs
By combining the skills of people from a diverse mix of R&D functions and working alongside industry partners, the PCOE not only aims to deliver a more diverse and inclusive consumer product experience but also “develop products and get them to market with speed,” he adds.
One example is the discovery that melanin-rich skin has a different ceramide make-up, resulting in higher trans-epidermal water loss which means it tends to be drier than other skin types. It can also lead to an ashen appearance if it isn’t properly hydrated.
The Vaseline team used these findings to add ‘Ultra Hydrating Lipids’ to Vaseline’s Intensive Care range. Alongside this, they developed a body care range to illuminate melanin-rich skins. This saw the moisturising formula in both lotions improved to provide up to 90% more moisture, while still offering the even skin tone, glow and radiance consumers love. Vaseline will continue to innovate specifically for melanin-rich skin in the future.
Other Unilever brands have used this insight to add to their product ranges too.
For example, one in every two babies in the US are people of colour, and Baby Dove has created a range of products, specifically designed to gently care for a baby’s melanin-rich skin, including a hypoallergenic wash, cream and soothing oil.
Sharing the science to address misconceptions
During their research, the team also discovered many consumers aren’t aware of the damage sunlight/UV light can cause to melanin-rich skin. 
To get the message on the importance of SPF usage out there, they worked with dermatologists of colour to create short social-first explainers.
In turn, the dermatologist community shared their insight that one of the barriers to the use of traditional SPF products is that they can sometimes leave a white film on darker skins.
Combining the science with this lifestyle insight helped the R&D team to create the award-winning skincare brand Melé with a built-in SPF that delivers both protection and aesthetics.
Adding insight and talent to our knowledge base
To move the dial and understand more about what polycultural consumers want, the PCOE team are further flexing the research part of their R&D.
Sharing key findings with the skincare community
An education programme is in place to share the PCOE’s findings with dermatologists and skincare specialists to fast-track further developments in more inclusive skincare.
Alongside this, the centre is running a programme of clinical and consumer research with thousands of people of colour to identify unique and common cross-category needs.
Building diversity into our supplier base and innovator funding
“The composition of the world is changing. Unilever’s global footprint gives us a significant opportunity to deliver for our polycultural consumers,” says Esi Eggleston Bracey, Unilever USA President and CEO of Personal Care, North America.
“As part of the Melanin Science Movement programme, in 2020, Unilever committed to double our funding dedicated to the research and creation of products for melanin-rich skin and textured hair; double our partnerships with diverse experts and suppliers; and provide funding for more than 50 research fellowships with innovators of colour,” says Schrooyen.
“And we’re on track to deliver,” he adds, “because we don’t just want to know and meet our consumers’ needs. We want to ensure the people who help make our products reflect the diversity of the people we make them for.”
text The Unstereotype Alliance, convened by UN Women and co-founded by Unilever, is an industry-led coalition working to eradicate harmful stereotypes in advertising.
Global research, commissioned by the Alliance and conducted by Ipsos, revealed the extent of everyday stereotypes and people’s responses to them.
It found that 73% of people regularly see or hear stereotyping. And yet only 30% who see or hear them happening say something or intervene.
Two universal reasons emerged for people’s silence – 50% don’t want to escalate the situation and 41% simply don’t know what to say.
As a result of this, the Unstereotype Alliance has launched a new campaign called ‘Say Nothing, Change Nothing’, co-piloted by Unilever.
The campaign highlights the collective power of standing up and speaking out against stereotypes and has been spearheaded by the star of Black Panther, actor, playwright, women’s rights activist and UN Goodwill Ambassador, Danai Gurira.
If you ‘say nothing, you change nothing’, silence is a form of complicity
Aline Santos, Chief Brand Officer and Chief Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Officer
In a bid to help people take positive action against stereotypes, the Unstereotype Alliance worked with behavioural scientists to create the Unstereotype 101 Guide, launched as part of the campaign.
The guide is full of practical tips and conversation starters to help people safely challenge stereotypical behaviour and confidently go from a bystander to an upstander.
“It may be a tough thing for people to hear, but if you ‘say nothing, you change nothing’, silence is a form of complicity”, says Aline Santos, Chief Brand Officer and Chief Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Officer at Unilever, and Deputy Vice Chair of the Unstereotype Alliance.
“It’s why we felt it was so important for Unilever to co-pilot this campaign – to show that we all have the power to challenge stereotypes,” Aline adds.
As people’s personal safety is key, the Unstereotype 101 Guide asks us to consider a three-step approach – STOP, SEE and SUGGEST. Here are some key, actionable takeaways and tips.
How to effectively combat stereotypes in a measured, controlled way
STOP
When someone uses a stereotype, pause and take a few deep breaths, and make an active choice to challenge the stereotype.
SEE
Don’t challenge the stereotype user.
Make sure you feel psychologically safe before you do anything.
If the situation happens online, the same advice applies. See if you can change the subject and make the stereotyped person feel welcome and included.
SUGGEST
Focus on what’s been said. Speak from your heart and from what you observe. Look to challenge the stereotype and not the person. Consider some of these examples of how to safely challenge:
“I’m wondering how others might feel when they hear you say that.”
“Here’s another way you could say that.”
“If I were in that situation, I think I would feel [describe what you feel].”
Together our voices can make a difference
“By sharing practical tools and encouraging conversation around this topic, we can give people the confidence to move from being a bystander to becoming an upstander,” Aline explains.
“If you speak up, then your friend may speak up. And one by one, the people around you may have the confidence to speak up,” she adds.
“Together, our voices can make a monumental difference in breaking down and eradicating stereotypes and creating a more equal world,” Aline adds, “one person, one situation and one word at a time.”

text Pot Noodle, the UK’s biggest instant hot snack brand, 1 is trialling a new recyclable paper pot, 2 made with FSC-certified paper. This is the most significant innovation to the brand’s iconic pot since it launched almost half a century ago.
The new paper pot has launched exclusively in retailer Tesco, with an initial stock of 500,000 of the brand’s most popular flavour, Chicken & Mushroom.
The trial will be used to gain shopper feedback and, if it’s successful, the aim is to switch the full Pot Noodle range to paper pots – a move which, once complete, could remove 4,000 tonnes of virgin plastic each year. 3 Insights from the trial will support the scale-up of the innovation at the Pot Noodle factory.
Innovating with alternative materials – like paper – will play an important role in delivering our commitment to halve our use of virgin plastic, alongside other innovations such as refillable bottles, increasing our use of recycled plastic, and moving to ultra-concentrated formulas which use smaller bottles.
Overcoming a tricky technical challenge
The innovation process to develop and refine the paper pot – which took over three years – was led by our R&D teams at Hive, Unilever’s Global Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands, working closely with packaging experts in the UK.
The challenge was to identify the most effective way to reduce the plastic used in each pot, while also ensuring the packaging still holds its distinctive shape and delivers the same quality eating experience that fans of the brand – affectionately known as Noodlers – have come to love.
We’re always challenging ways to make our products and packaging better.
Andre Burger, General Manager Foods (Nutrition), UK & Ireland
As Andre Burger, General Manager Foods (Nutrition) at Unilever UK & Ireland, says: “Pot Noodle has been a much-loved British brand for over 40 years, and while our great taste will never change, we’re always challenging ways to make our products and packaging better.
“From material development and testing through to new manufacturing processes and capabilities, big packaging innovations require the investment of time and expertise across many teams and partners. There have been plenty of challenges along the way, but we are committed to reducing the plastic in our packaging and to a paper-based future for our pots, without compromising on the Pot Noodle experience our shoppers know and love. We are now excited to learn from this initial trial with the ambition of bringing our paper pots to more shoppers across the UK soon.”
The new pots can be recycled at home with other cardboard and paper and include on-pack recycling labels to provide clear guidance to UK shoppers on how to dispose of the packaging. A single layer of ultra-thin plastic film is used to provide barrier protection, which ensures ingredients remain fresh and protects the paper when water is added but doesn’t inhibit the recyclability of the pot.
This new pack marks the latest step in Pot Noodle’s strategy of driving innovation within the category, whether that’s flavours or formats. And it’s a strategy that’s proved successful. The brand has delivered consistent double-digit growth over the last three years.
Stirring it up
It’s not just our pots we’re investing in. Pot Noodle has continued its Stir It Up campaign, which supports young people entering the job market by offering alternative internships that align with their career passions.
Since its launch in 2018, the campaign has helped 450 people find internships, supported over 370 to come off benefits and secured permanent positions for more than 110 others. Already this year, it has received over 10,000 applications from people across the UK, attracting other big businesses – like Ubisoft, the Premier League, Channel 4 and Sony – to also place candidates.

Around 45% of Pakistan’s urban population live in slums. Families live in a single room, streets are narrow and front doors are often just a metre apart. Social distancing cannot be made a reality. As Covid reached the country, Affan Khan, who works in Home Care as Assistant Brand Manager for Sunlight & Liquids, realised how vulnerable these densely populated areas were.
“Living near a slum, I knew how difficult it would be for people to actually disinfect and understand the preventive measures that are needed to keep coronavirus at bay,” he says.
Affan’s response was immediate. Recognising the need to disinfect public places, he made contact with local government officials to set up a mass disinfection drive. “The idea was to disinfect potential hotspots for coronavirus,” he explains. Within days, he had galvanised stakeholders – internal and external – into action. Affan works in the Home Care division but not on the Domex (Domestos) brand. But he brought together different functions and categories to move mountains at a time when the big institutions hadn’t even woken up to the challenge. The drive reached 30 cities.
Looking rather like spacemen, the disinfection teams – wearing full-body protective clothing – had containers of Domex disinfectant strapped to their backs and sprayed public places.
All types of buildings likely to present a Covid risk were covered: hospitals, jails, police stations, welfare organisations and government offices, together with densely populated apartment complexes. Vulnerable slums also received visits from the spraying teams during the drive. The practical disinfection efforts were coupled with education drills for residents, ensuring they could continue doing it on their own afterwards.
Safer worship during Ramadan
In April, with cases still rising, Ramadan was approaching. The government planned to reopen mosques for worship, increasing the risk to public health and safety. So Affan extended the mass disinfection drive to mosques. Over 1,000 places of worship were disinfected. The contact at each mosque was given a month’s supply of Domex and in-depth hygiene education was provided.
The impact of the mass disinfection initiative has been immense. Over 1 million citizens were directly protected, 1,500 public places were disinfected and countless families have benefited. The efforts of Affan and Unilever have made a contribution to controlling the virus in Pakistan.
“The feeling you get when you know you have made a difference in someone’s life… it’s so gratifying,” says Affan. “Unilever has played a huge role in making sure the [Covid] numbers stay low in Pakistan.”
text Unilever has set itself an agenda to keep plastic in the loop through a commitment to collect and process more plastic than it sells, cut the use of virgin plastic in half, and use 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging.
As part of our global commitment, Unilever Pakistan is making efforts to reduce plastic waste from the ecosystem through innovative recycling and behaviour change campaigns aimed at changing shoppers approach to plastics use in the long term.
Sunsilk Refill Station
Sunsilk Refill Station now installed at CSD lal kurti, Rawalpindi as a first step towards creating awareness about cutting down the use of single use plastic. So far, the concept has been wonderfully embraced by our shoppers and we urge you all to play your part in keeping plastic in the loop by visiting our refilling stations. Dont forget to drop by with your used plastic bottles from home and availing upto 15% discount. 
Lipton Ecofill Station
With an aim to reduce our plastic footprint and encourage eco-friendly practices in the country, Unilever Pakistan is proud to share the deployment of Lipton tea-fill station with you, at CSD in Rawalpindi. Through this deployment, consumers can fill their tea pouch in an eco-friendly bag while availing an exciting discount. This would help us eliminate plastic jars and pouches from the environment and play our part in movement towards the circular economy. So far we have already been able to eliminate over 7000 pouches/jars from the environment, and we look forward to increase this number with the support of our consumers 
Closing the loop to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle
Unilever Pakistan has partnered with CSD through which both entities have pledged to rigorously drive the agenda of reducing, reusing, and recycling plastics.
With CSD, Unilever Pakistan will plant 10,000 saplings, eliminate 21,000 pouches/bottles, and recycle 2500 KGs of plastics over the course of next 18 months. The recent ceremony was held at CSD head office in Rawalpindi, which was attended by the senior leadership of both organizations.
Road towards a Circular Economy and Purpose Led Growth
Nosherwan Ali, Vice President of Customer Development, Unilever Pakistan highlighted, “The Customer Development Team at Unilever Pakistan, which is our sales function, is fully committed towards purpose led growth and we are making efforts to address the plastics waste challenge to help Pakistan transition towards a circular economy with the support of our key business partners.
Unilever Pakistan is also investing in other models that help in creating a circular economy. The company recently announced projects for a plastic waste free model city in Rahim Yar Khan, as well as brand led initiatives on sustainable plastic reuse. These collaborations are part of Unilever Pakistan’s larger vision on environment and climate action.

text The year 2020 brought along many unpresented problems. Although the use of disposable masks was the temporary solution to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, but the surging plastic usage it sparked has also had an adverse effect on our environment.
It comes as no surprise that the uncountable carelessly disposed-off face masks, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other plastic waste are adding to the already high levels of pollution in the country, which also appears as a high-risk health factor, considering the pandemic is still on a rise.
Plastic has its place and that is not in the environment
Unilever Pakistan, as one of the biggest global consumer company, has pledged its commitment to a waste-free world and continues to put in efforts to minimize plastic waste. We are on track to ensure our packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. With our move towards a circular economy, we ensure that we not only manage our plastic waste better but also to rethink our packaging model to use less plastic as well as manage the waste in a better way.
As part of Unilever Pakistan’s sustainable goals, UNDP and Unilever have joined hands to work towards enabling a plastic waste management ecosystem in the city of Rahim Yar Khan. This place has a key importance to Unilever as its first and largest factory in Pakistan has recently been declared to become a “Zero Plastic Waste City by 2025”. Unilever recognized its part in the plastic waste cycle and has worked towards giving back to its home city by providing a model that can be replicated across the country over the years. UNDP and Unilever is working together towards making this goal a reality.

About Lifebuoy
Each year, 1.7 million children don’t reach their fifth birthday due to diarrhoea and pneumonia. Over 40% of under-five deaths occur within the first 28 days of a child’s life, the neonatal period, accounting for nearly half of the 18,000 children under age five dying every day. Diarrhoea alone results in 3,000 children every day dying before their fifth birthday. Many of these deaths are easily preventable through a simple practice of washing hands with soap - one of the most effective and low cost ways to prevent diseases. To ensure sustainable living, we need to address the negligence involved in hand-washing.Lifebuoy is committed to saving lives through hand-washing and hygiene education. Lifebuoy helps and inspires billions of consumers to make, hand-washing with soap, a habit. Lifebuoy aims to makes a positive difference in the world by working towards the improvement of health and hygiene.

Unilever is already on track to achieve its existing commitments to ensure all of its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and to use at least 25% recycled plastic in its packaging, also by 2025.
Alan Jope, Unilever CEO, said: “Plastic has its place, but that place is not in the environment. We can only eliminate plastic waste by acting fast and taking radical action at all points in the plastic cycle.
“Our starting point has to be design, reducing the amount of plastic we use, and then making sure that what we do use increasingly comes from recycled sources. We are also committed to ensuring all our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable.
“This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to our packaging and products. It requires us to introduce new and innovative packaging materials and scale up new business models, like re-use and re-fill formats, at an unprecedented speed and intensity.”
Unilever’s commitment will require the business to help collect and process around 600,000 tonnes of plastic annually by 2025. This will be delivered through investment and partnerships which improve waste management infrastructure in many of the countries in which Unilever operates.
Jope added: “Our vision is a world in which everyone works together to ensure that plastic stays in the economy and out of the environment. Our plastic is our responsibility and so we are committed to collecting back more than we sell, as part of our drive towards a circular economy. This is a daunting but exciting task which will help drive global demand for recycled plastic.”
Ellen MacArthur, Founder, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said: "Today’s announcement by Unilever is a significant step in creating a circular economy for plastic. By eliminating unnecessary packaging through innovations such as refill, reuse, and concentrates, while increasing their use of recycled plastic, Unilever is demonstrating how businesses can move away from virgin plastics. We urge others to follow their lead, so collectively we can eliminate the plastic we don’t need, innovate, so what we do need is circulated, and ultimately build an economic system where plastic packaging never becomes waste."
Since 2017, Unilever has been transforming its approach to plastic packaging through its ‘Less, Better, No’ plastic framework.
Through Less Plastic Unilever has explored new ways of packaging and delivering products - including concentrates, such as its new Cif Eco-refill which eliminates 75% of plastic, and new refill stations for shampoo and laundry detergent rolled out across shops, universities and mobile vending in South East Asia.
Better plastic has led to pioneering innovations such as the new detectable pigment being used by Axe (Lynx) and TRESemmé , which makes black plastic recyclable, as it can now be seen and sorted by recycling plant scanners, and the Lipton ‘festival bottle’ which is made of 100% recycled plastic and is collected using a deposit scheme.
As part of No plastic, Unilever has brought to the market innovations including shampoo bars, refillable toothpaste tablets, cardboard deodorant sticks and bamboo toothbrushes. It has also signed up to the Loop platform, which is exploring new ways of delivering and collecting reusable products from consumers’ homes.
As part of today’s announcement, Unilever has posted a video on its website addressing the issue of ocean plastic and committing to play its part to ‘make the blue planet, blue again’.
Notes to Editors
Unilever’s plastic packaging footprint today is around 700,000 tonnes annually (including recent acquisitions).
The company is today making two commitments:
1) Reduce our virgin plastic packaging by 50% by 2025, with one third (more than 100,000 tonnes) coming from an absolute plastic reduction.
More than 100,000 tonnes will come from an absolute reduction as the business invests in multiple use packs (reusable and/or refillable), ‘no plastic’ solutions (alternative packaging materials or naked products) and reduces the amount of plastic in existing packs (concentration). Replacing non-recycled plastic packaging with recycled plastics will account for the remaining reduction. Unilever will measure the total tonnes of virgin plastic packaging used each year vs the total tonnes of virgin plastic packaging used in 2018. As a result of this commitment, Unilever is committing to have a virgin plastic packaging footprint of no more than 350,000 tonnes by 2025.
2) Help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.
Unilever’s commitment will require the business to help collect and process around 600,000 tonnes of plastic annually by 2025. This is less than our current 700,000 tonnes plastic packaging footprint because it reflects the 100,000 tonnes absolute reduction we have committed to above.
Unilever will deliver this commitment by:
i) Investment and partnerships in waste collection and processing
ii) Purchasing and using recycled plastics in its packaging
iii) Participating in extended producer responsibility schemes where Unilever directly pays for the collection of its packaging
Unilever will measure the total tonnes of plastic packaging it has helped collect and process in a year vs how much plastic packaging it has used.
Over the last five years, Unilever has collaborated with many partners to collect plastic packaging, including the United Nations Development Programme, to help segregate, collect and recycle packaging across India. In addition, it has helped to establish almost 3,000 waste banks in Indonesia, offering more than 400,000 people the opportunity to recycle their waste. In Brazil, Unilever has a long-running partnership with retailer Grupo Pão de Açúcar to help collect waste through drop-off stations.
text Pakistan has ranked steady at 148/149 on the WEF’s Gender Gap Index, with various challenges faces by women in the country with regards to social indicators like health, education & financial inclusion. With an almost gender equal population, 80% of our female population struggles with quality access to work.
Unilever is helping address this through its Guddi Baji livelihoods program. Guddi Baji, literally meaning “The Good Sister” – functions as a female community influencer program, which helps women open the door to economic empowerment. The project envisions to bridge the prevailing gender gap by giving women in rural Pakistan the tools to become entrepreneurs.
Through Guddi Baji, we have created an entrepreneurial movement whereby progressive women in villages are given an opportunity to act as ambassadors and route-to-market agents for Unilever providing a means of income for them to support their families. This model incorporates recruitment and training in collaboration with a social partner that commands a strong footprint in rural Pakistan.
We developed a partnership and consortium with a local social welfare organization – the Rural Support Program Network - to connect with the most vulnerable people in local communities. Through this platform, we have created an entrepreneurial movement whereby women in villages are given an opportunity to act as ambassadors and route-to-market agents for Unilever, providing a means of income for them to support their families. This model incorporates recruitment, training and capability building via comprehensive training tools, focusing on techniques to run profitable businesses.
Now, 1,700 women across Pakistan are self-employed Unilever ambassadors and distributors, while also acting as healthcare agents. Our partnership allowed us to reach women in rural communities and help enhance their livelihoods, which is one of Unilever’s Sustainable Living Goals as well as the UNDP Sustainable Development Goals 5, 8, and 10.
Today, the Guddi Baji network empowers almost a million women, delivering on our purpose to create value for society through access to trusted brands, financial inclusion and well-being support.
text October 16, 2019: Lifebuoy Shampoo announced its partnership with The Citizens Foundation (TCF) to facilitate education for 10,000 girls across Pakistan at an exclusive Press Conference which was held at the TCF school in Korangi on Wednesday, 16th October 2019. Having collaborated with TCF last year, the idea behind the renewed engagement is to raise and create awareness about Girl Child Education in Pakistan on a much larger scale.
This vision is powered by insights that indicate that every second girl in Pakistan is out of school. Recognizing the value that can be unlocked by addressing this challenge, Lifebuoy Shampoo is working to secure a better future for girls in Pakistan by raising awareness and enabling their access to education.
Citizens can join hands with Lifebuoy Shampoo and TCF in this effort to raise awareness for Girl Child Education by sharing this message through Lifebuoy Shampoo’s Film “Beti Parhao Usse Mazboot Banao” on Facebook or YouTube. Lifebuoy Shampoo will also engage rural communities through meaningful content around the subject to encourage an open mind towards female education and drive an upward shift in girls’ enrollment across Pakistan.
Asima Haq, Director - Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever Pakistan, expressed her commitment to the cause, saying, “For the last few years, Lifebuoy Shampoo has been talking about raising stronger daughters. In 2018, we embarked on a journey to leverage education as a key enabler to raise stronger daughters in Pakistan. This year we are committed to making a bigger impact by not only raising awareness for girl child education, but also recruiting more girls into the education system by partnering with TCF. We strongly believe that by educating a girl you open up possibilities of a better future not only for her but also her family”.
Syed Asaad Ayub Ahmad, CEO, The Citizens Foundation, also shared his views on the partnership, “Our organization seeks to address the massive challenge of illiteracy in Pakistan, and every day we witness how educating girls can unlock economic empowerment and wellbeing for entire households and inspire communities around them. I encourage everyone to join hands with us and help raise strong educated daughters who can secure the growth for our country”.

text KARACHI, 4 April 2019: Unilever Pakistan has partnered with doctHERs to implement a gender-inclusive, technology-enabled healthcare solution across rural Pakistan.
The project, titled ‘Sukh Saheli’, will use the widespread reach of Unilever’s rural retail program to deliver high-quality health and wellness services for 1 million women across rural Pakistan in 2019. Frontline health workers will mobilize underserved communities in over 4000 villages and connect them to qualified, female doctors via telemedicine, HD video-consultation and digital, diagnostic tools.
The collaboration is being supported by TRANSFORM, a joint-initiative between Unilever and the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) to support business models and behaviour change interventions to deliver market-based solutions for low-income household needs.
The program brings together social enterprise agility with private sector ingenuity and commercial reach to contribute towards Pakistan’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. Unilever has provided access to its rural retail program, called Mera Sona Goan. doctHERs will match the underutilized capacity of female doctors (working from home) to the unmet healthcare needs of rural communities.
Shazia Syed, Chairperson & CEO, Unilever Pakistan, highlighted, “I believe we must leverage the reach of Unilever’s business to positively benefit the communities we work in. With this program we will be the enablers for wellbeing, health education and inclusion for rural women across Pakistan.”
Elin Burns, the British Deputy High Commissioner, added, “It's fantastic to see a technology savvy programme, which will use the private sector's reach and UK aid money to help deliver healthcare facilities for women in Pakistan. I'm especially pleased that the UK’s Department for International Development and Unilever have come together with a Pakistani start-up company to deliver this initiative.”
Säbeen Fatima Haque, Executive Director, doctHERs, concluded by saying: “At doctHERs, we’re excited to collaborate with Unilever Pakistan to improve the lives of rural women. One of our shared objectives is to integrate corporates partners to further amplify the impact of this program.”
text 29 July, 2020, Karachi - Unilever Pakistan and VentureDive have unveiled details of their unique collaboration, Munchies. The start up is a disruptive snacking ecommerce solution that aims to provide consumers with instant delivery of snacking items using a dedicated delivery fleet. This was shared during an exclusive Fire side Chat organised by Nest I/O.
The session was hosted by Jehan Ara, as an acknowledgment of the NEST IO, where the idea was developed during a hackathon jointly organised by the Nest IO and Unilever in 2018. The chat detailed the workings of the hyper-local model that began with the ambition to “UBERise” the Company’s Ice Cream category.
Today, Munchies is making its space in a $2 billion snacking whitespace and even as a recent entrant in the impulse snacking category, the app has gained momentum quickly. Within six months it has moved from an initial 1,000 downloads to over 50,000 installations whilst amassing a loyal customer base.
Personified by its slogan “Lazy but proud”, Munchies has built a quirky, authentic and relatable brand personality that understands and simplifies instant snacking for fans and followers alike. The app empowers users with the choice of refueling on their favourite snackables – chocolates, chips or ice cream, whenever they crave it. This convenience is enabled by a hyperlocal model that sends orders placed to the nearest “buddy” in your location who fulfils the order from nearby retail stores and completes the loop with doorstep delivery.
Unilever and VentureDive are aggressively scaling the service. This is already evident in not only the in-app functionality and offering, but also the pace with which the service has grown to cover Karachi since its pilot days. The first step towards this goal is Munchies progression into an independent entity with its own dedicated leadership and team. As a replicable model that brings together a legacy of Unilever’s experience in the consumer goods space with VentureDive’s tech enablement and uses this to facilitate an ever escalating need for convenience, the outlook for Munchies signals a long term growth trajectory.
Amir Paracha Chairman and CEO of Unilever Pakistan Limited, said, “The genesis of the concept for Munchies actually came out of our endeavor to UBERise Wall’s delivery. In Pakistan, snack consumption is primarily driven by impulse purchase, and people generally don’t stock up on snacks. After tinkering with this insight over time, we decided to create an app which would provide consumers Ice Cream or any other snack within 30 mins on the press of a button.”
Atif Azim, CEO, VentureDive, added, “What hooked us onto the idea was the concept of a large forward facing MNC like Unilever wanting to collaborate with a tech company like Venture Dive with a shared goal to disrupt the industry. While we initially thought of Munchies as project-based engagement it soon morphed into a much deeper relationship to the point where we are now looking to collectively scale up and build an independent organization.”
Tasked to lead Unilever’s new Strategy and Digital Transformation function, Syed Fawad Ahmed also expressed his views on Munchies as a key component in Unilever’s foray into e-commerce, saying “Despite facing challenges typical to the hyper-local model, the initial reviews from consumers have been very positive, especially as we have been quite successful in fulfilling the promise of timely service. It is also a telling sign that we have already been proactively approached by several snack manufacturers, both local and multinational, as they identify Munchies as a solution to the Ecommerce challenge for impulse products.”
Saad Fazil, Co Founder and Managing Director at VentureDive, chimed in, saying, “We are extremely aggressive and focused in our mission to revolutionise the snacking industry. This is the niche that will always remain core to Munchies and we will provide an assortment and range that is exclusive to the platform. Our vision for the future is to promise a 24/7 service that delivers within 10 minutes.”

text Unilever Pakistan partnered with the Customer IPR Enforcement team to identify and restrict the network of counterfeit products. The destroyed counterfeit consignments were seized over the last year in multiple operations to identify and intercept fake product made locally and imported illegally into the country.
Dr. Arslan Subuctageen, DG Customs highlighted the need for collaboration with the corporate sector, saying, “We have worked closely with Unilever and other MNCs to address and eliminate the sources of counterfeit for brands like Glow and Lovely, Sunsilk and others over the past year and this has helped us identify risks better whilst significantly reducing the inflow of counterfeits in the country.”
Aly Yusuf, Finance Director, Unilever Pakistan added, “Consumer safety is a top priority for us and the presence of counterfeit products threatens the wellbeing of our consumers. With timely and strategic action from the Customs IPR Enforcement team, we have ensured that the counterfeit products were confiscated and destroyed. It works for the benefit of consumers, us and the national exchequer.”
Counterfeits pose multiple threats to consumer health and safety as they are typically produced with harmful ingredients and without regard for users’ wellbeing. Low quality personal care counterfeits carry significant hazards and can even lead to long term health issues.
text A majority of the investment will be made to enhance manufacturing operations across Unilever’s four factories in Pakistan over the next two years. This is a testament to Unilever’s commitment to growing the business in Pakistan and highlights the increasing uptake of consumer good products across the country.
Adviser Finance, whilst appreciating the initiative of Unilever, added that the investment was indeed an acknowledgement of the country’s growth potential and the macroeconomic stability it has gained during the last four years of the current Government.
Shazia Syed, Chairperson & CEO, Unilever Pakistan Limited, highlighted “We have been a part of Pakistan’s growth for nearly 70 years, during which time we have seen our business grow to over 30 brands in areas of Home Care, Personal Care, Foods, Beverages and Ice Cream. We take pride in the fact that over 95% of our brands are produced locally, creating employment for thousands, contributing to the exchequer of the country and simultaneously creating a better future every day for the people of Pakistan.”
Unilever’s operations in Pakistan are counted amongst the best performing businesses units within Unilever’s global operations. In 2013, Unilever Overseas Holding, which is a majority shareholder in Unilever Pakistan Limited, invested over €400 Million (USD 530 Million) in Pakistan which is the single largest foreign direct investment in the recent history of Pakistan. This investment re-affirmed Unilever’s strong commitment to local operations and to Pakistan’s economic potential.

Cleaning our homes took on new meaning during the pandemic, but it’s no longer just about killing germs and removing stains. It has increasingly become about satisfying experiences. And nowhere is that better illustrated than with #CleanTok. This is TikTok’s cleaning community and it’s the biggest thing on the platform by a mile.
We have launched a new, exclusive and global #CleanTok partnership which aims to tap into this huge and rapidly expanding audience.
It’s an opportunity for us to provide information to consumers and inspire them on how to use our products. It also gives us a unique insight into how they use our products, as well as what they do and don’t like about them. This two-way dialogue is like sitting down and having a chat with millions of people who use our products each day.
The partnership, which includes all our Home Care brands such as Dirt Is Good (DIG), Cif, Domestos, Sunlight and Comfort, will run until January 2024 in the UK, Vietnam, Turkey, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, France, the Netherlands, Argentina and Indonesia. During this time, our Cleanipedia website, which provides tips and advice on cleaning, will be #CleanTok’s exclusive sponsor.
“There is a huge amount of emotion attached to our homes,” says Eduardo Campanella, our Home Care Chief Marketing Officer. “So, while cleaning products have been traditionally seen as functional, and the act of cleaning as a chore, the results that come from using the right products in the right way can bring a huge amount of satisfaction.”
The rise of ‘cleanfluencers’ and content creators
Born out of the pandemic, TikTok’s global #CleanTok trend is fuelled by ‘cleanfluencers’ and authentic content creators, who elevated the role cleaning plays in our lives, taking a category traditionally viewed as mundane and making it one of the most loved and entertaining genres.
Since then, the cleaning boom and newly formed consumer habits, have led to over 79 billion views of #CleanTok and its associated video content, surpassing other popular trends including #BeautyTok with 50 billion views. The partnership aims to celebrate the shift in perception from cleaning as a chore to a form of entertainment, which is amassing millions of fans across the globe.
And data shows that these fans convert to consumers. For example, 54% of users have bought a household product after seeing it on the platform – with 71% of these being unplanned purchases. Almost 70% say that TikTok played a role in their discovery of household products. And TikTokers are 1.5 times more likely to immediately go out and buy something they discovered compared to the users of other platforms.
A global phenomenon with cultural nuances
The great thing about #CleanTok is that there’s a cleanfluencer for everyone. You can find somebody that appeals to you – young, old, male, female, family, single – and whatever your cleaning style or needs, whether that’s hacks, transformations or deep cleans.
But while #CleanTok is the unifying theme, it is executed differently around the world due to local cultural nuances. An interesting way this shows up is during family holidays. There’s a wave of search in-app for home cleaning tips and tricks before any holiday moment when family visits, from Ramadan to Christmas. Parents coming around is a universal trigger to get scrubbing!
We also see #CleanTok engagement spikes at key moments such as spring cleaning, back to school and preparation for different festivities. It’s at these times that younger people look to #CleanTok for information and inspiration.
Collaborating on content
Teams at both Unilever and TikTok will work with over 100 content creators to serve their followers with useful and entertaining content such as cleaning hacks, tips and product reviews, promoting the #CleanTok movement. All content can be found in the dedicated in-app #CleanTok hub on TikTok.
To start the partnership, we’re working with @chrisjoyz (5.2 million followers), @mumukdaneno (1.8 million followers) and @senalicann (226,000 followers).
“The rise of #CleanTok shows just how attached we are to making our homes look, feel and smell good,” says Eduardo. “We want to continue to inspire and educate people and, by working with TikTok’s creative teams to develop new and engaging content, we hope to gain valuable insights into a growing audience of young people who are just as passionate about cleaning as we are.”
text When it comes to bacon, expectations run high.
The perfect rasher should deliver not only a balanced hit of smoky, salty flavours but also a crispy texture that is neither dry nor chewy.
Delivering these high standards is difficult enough with traditional animal-based meat. However, The Vegetarian Butcher’s new hack has cracked it with a 100% plant-based recipe that comes closer than ever to a like-for-like bacon experience, thanks to new plant protein technology.
Perfecting texture and taste
Like the original NoBacon bacon, this new version is made from soya and wheat protein with no artificial colours or preservatives.
However, it is plant oils that really make The Vegetarian Butcher’s latest bacon innovation such an authentic experience.
Here are three reasons why:
Friendly fat
The issue: In traditional bacon, fat is rendered during cooking, allowing the meat to be cooked in it. Previously, The Vegetarian Butcher plant-based bacon did not release any oils during cooking and therefore had to be prepared with added fat.
The solution: Thanks to recently developed patented food technology, the newly added oil droplets in the NoBacon increases fat release to 20 times that of previous versions, which means it can be fried without any additional fat. The result is a crispy rasher and appetising smell.
Tender texture
The issue: A common problem with plant-based products is the texture, which is often described as chewy or dry.
The solution: Thanks to the new fat tissue technology, made from a careful combination of plant-based ingredients, the new NoBacon strips can be separated easily when raw, and crisp up better when cooked.
Translucency
The issue: The Vegetarian Butcher's original plant-based bacon did not react to heat like traditional animal-based meat, which in turn affected the consumer cooking experience.
The solution: The Vegetarian Butcher’s new fat tissue technology uses a careful selection of plant-based ingredients that make the rashers’ ‘fat’ becomes translucent while cooking, just like their animal meat counterparts.
A healthier recipe for the planet
But the benefits of NoBacon go well beyond the frying pan. It is also delivering a significant win for Unilever’s commitment to providing food that is good for the planet.
"Releasing all animals from the food chain is not just good news for animals, it’s also great news for our planet," says Hugo Verkuil, CEO of The Vegetarian Butcher.
“Taking animals out of the equation makes the food system more efficient and more environmentally friendly. Instead of feeding legumes to animals and making meat out of these living creatures, The Vegetarian Butcher makes plant-based meat directly from legumes,” he explains.
And there is more good news. By reducing the amount of soy that is otherwise used for animal feed, plant-based meat like that produced by The Vegetarian Butcher significantly reduces the pressure on ecosystems, enabling more people to get the nutrition they need.
"Our plant-based bacon’s taste and texture is fantastic, so it truly is a win-win-win", says Hugo.

text This year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup™ was a landmark for women’s football, with over 1.9 million fans attending matches across the tournament’s 64 matches.
The tournament also kick-started our Unilever Personal Care brands’ – including Rexona, Dove, LUX and Lifebuoy – sponsorship of FIFA, a partnership deal which will run through to 2027 and include the FIFA World Cup 2026, FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 and FIFA eSports.
The partnership also marks the first time that FIFA has teamed up with Personal Care brands across women’s, men’s, and FIFA eSports.
Here are four ways the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023™ is proving to be a win–win for the beautiful game and Unilever’s personal care brands.
1. Making the most of unmatched global exposure
Global viewing figures for this year’s event exceeded 2 billion, up from 1.12 billion in 2019.
“In recent years, women’s football has undergone a remarkable transformation as a brand opportunity,” says Samir Singh, Global Chief Marketing Officer at Unilever Personal Care. “Once overlooked, it now spearheads cultural change.”
What’s more, FIFA has huge global scale. This year’s tournament was the first to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. It included eight new teams, including Morocco’s Atlas Lionesses who were the first team to qualify from the Arab world, bringing the total number of competing nations to 32.
In Australia, which co-hosted the event with New Zealand, sales of the Matildas’ team kit outstripped those of the men’s team for the first time ever. The Matildas’ match against England became the most watched television programme of all time, sport or otherwise, reaching 11.5+ million viewers (over 40% of Australia’s population).
“If we want to drive systemic change, then collaborating with an entity of FIFA’s scale enables us both to move forward faster,” adds Rexona Global Brand Lead, Kathryn Swallow.
Personal Care’s global marketing teams set about creating content and campaigns to disrupt and be unmissable, with sponsorship content and visuals on online channels, in retail outlets, across continents and in every major football-playing country.
“The whole point is that you don’t use sponsorship as something on the outside, as a mere badge, but have it at the core of brands, in innovation, advertising and the mission,” Samir told leading marketing industry title The Drum.
2. Leveraging digital engagement: TikTok, influencer content and Roblox
Going where your customers are is a marketing truism, and fans of women’s football are on social channels, especially TikTok.
According to Marketing Dive TikTok Newsroom posts with the hashtag #WomensFootball have garnered more than 3.7 billion video views to date. The hashtags #FIFAWorldCup, #FIFAWomensWorldCup and #FIFAWWC have received more than 38.2 billion combined views on the platform... and counting.
Maximising this unique opportunity to connect our brands to a highly engaged audience saw Unilever, FIFA and TikTok join forces to create experiences that would enrich the game for fans and inspire the next generation of girls looking to join the No.1 confidence-building sport.
Throughout the tournament, TikTok, FIFA and Unilever Personal Care brands including Rexona (aka Degree, Sure and Shield) and Dove shared behind-the-scenes moments, team arrivals, live pre-match content player and coach reactions.
World Cup winner Heather O’Reilly from the US joined Rexona at the Sydney Football Stadium with football stars Lia Lewis (UK) and Raquel Freestyle (Brazil) who went head-to-head in fun football challenges that they shared on their social channels.
In the gaming space, FIFA World X Roblox launched Rexona Obby. Player ambassadors including Trinity Rodman, Lauren James and Melanie Leupolz were turned into digital avatars so fans could interact with them in social spaces as well as earn rewards and digital collectibles.
In Brazil, cutting-edge AI technology was used to develop a football sticker album of the future, with young players from Rexona’s Breaking the Limits football academy pictured as future players in the national team.
“We used one of the football elements that ignites people’s imagination the most: the sticker album. Utilising AI helped inspire not only the girls in our Breaking Limits programme but also all Brazilian girls to dream about the future,” says Poliana Sousa, Personal Care Lead in Brazil.

“Digital allowed us to find our own voice and role in the tournament, and continues to do so in ongoing conversations,” says Rexona’s Kathryn Swallow.
“It’s not one-way traffic where we’re just on transmit mode. We’re joining conversations which actually allow us to learn and have a dialogue with consumers,” she says.
In that last 30 days, the hashtag #Rexona was used on social 55 million times. The third most popular country for its usage was the tournament’s co-host, Australia.
“We specifically measure how this FIFA affiliation will change how consumers feel about the brand. There’s also reach and the amount of earned media we get back,” Kathryn explains.
These rich engagement figures show how well brand content connected Rexona with the passion and enthusiasm surrounding the women’s game and the event.
3. Tailoring localised campaigns to maximise impact
The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023™ also provided Unilever with the opportunity to look at strategic market penetration across the 32 countries that had teams competing in the event.
Unilever marketing teams worked to create tailored market-specific campaigns that looked to resonate with local audiences, foster loyalty and expand market reach.
As well as being a significant opportunity for our brands to engage a growing audience of women’s football fans and build brand power, campaigns also looked to promote gender equality in sports.
During the tournament, LUX’s Middle East team created player content with the Saudi women’s football champion Farah Jefry, who showcased her skills in a short film to kick stereotyped messaging about women’s football into touch.
The film got more than 580,000 views and 11 million likes on TikTok, more than 2 million views on YouTube and over 2,500 comments on Instagram.
These campaign assets were supported by a retail activation in one of Saudi Arabia’s biggest shopping malls where Egyptian actress and former Olympic swimmer, Yasmine Sabri, gave a talk about role models. Women in the audience were also offered the chance to try the sport by kicking a ball at real-life tweets that contained harmful stereotypes of the women’s game.
4. Driving purpose + performance
Beyond the spotlight of the tournament, the goal of Unilever’s collaboration with FIFA is about “seamlessly weaving FIFA into the fabric of our brand’s DNA,” Samir told PRWeek.
“Six in ten girls feel disconnected from football. Our brands possess the potential to inspire these girls, fostering confidence and inclusivity,” he says.
To do this, the authentic alignment of purpose with performance is key, with each brand having a unique role it will play to get girls to play.
With its mission to give more girls the opportunity to play football, Rexona has been working with US player Christen Press. Rexona launched a ‘Change the Field’ programme to encourage more girls of colour to play soccer.
It’s also created a set of ‘Girls Can’ training modules that equip coaches and teachers with the skills to ensure equal opportunities in football which are available for girls to access in countries including Brazil, UK, US, Argentina, Australia and Mexico, with further expansion in the pipeline.
Dove, which is well known for its work in championing body positivity, will look to empower girls to excel on the field.
Lifebuoy is working to engage youth teams in rural communities and to ensure that young girls don’t miss a single day of practice.
And through its indulgent beauty and bath products, LUX powers women with the strength to express their femininity without fear of everyday sexist judgements.
The work of each of these Personal Care brands during the tournament has provided a winning start in driving more interest in the women’s game.
“What our teams and brands have achieved in only 90 days from signing the sponsorship deal to the start of the tournament is incredible. We are already seeing the positive impact our brands can have on young people and society, as well as benefiting our business overall,” says Fabian Garcia, President of Personal Care.

“There is a lot more we can achieve over the next five years. To quote Rexona’s tagline from the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023™ campaigns, we’re #JustWarmingUp.”
text We’re setting out to eradicate stereotypes from influencer brand content – and we’re calling on all influencers, brands and the advertising industry to join us and do the same.
Our new research with 3,300 Generation Z consumers from the UK, US and Brazil * reveals stereotypes are being perpetuated by influencers in branded content across social media, knowingly or unknowingly. And the respondents to our survey said it had a profound effect on how they view society.
93% of Generation Z consumers say they’ve seen stereotypes on social media
More than half said it contributed to the frustration (57%), anxiety (55%), sadness (55%) and anger (52%) they have felt while using social media
Anxiety was higher among the LGBTQI+ (68%) and disabled (75%) communities
73% of our respondents said they felt the world was increasingly divided
64% said they felt the online space was unsafe as a result of exposure to stereotypes
And 61% said brands and influencers have a responsibility to ensure their branded content is not stereotypical, and helps contribute to a safer, more inclusive and unstereotypical world.
By working with influencers to eradicate stereotypes, not only can we help them stay true to who they are, champion creativity and achieve our own brand goals, we’ll also play an important role in supporting underserved communities and driving equity for all more broadly.
Aline Santos, Chief Brand Officer and Chief ED&I Officer, Unilever
Building unstereotyping into brand partnership contracts
To ensure all influencer content created for our brands is unstereotypical, progressive and authentic, new guidance around stereotypes will now be included in all Unilever’s brand partnership contracts, encouraging influencers to assess whether their content may include harmful stereotypes and provoke more inclusive thinking.
This builds on the total ban on any digital alternation to change a person’s body shape, size, proportion or skin colour that we implemented in 2021 as part of our Act 2 Unstereotype commitment.
Aline Santos, Chief Brand Officer and Chief Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Officer at Unilever, says: “We know that social media and influencers are providing a safe and inclusive space for Gen Z consumers and as brands, we have a huge responsibility to protect this environment and ensure stereotypes are not being portrayed or perpetuated in our own content or influencer brand content.
“By working with influencers to eradicate stereotypes, not only can we help them stay true to who they are, champion creativity and achieve our own brand goals, we’ll also play an important role in supporting underserved communities and driving equity for all more broadly.”
Our new guide to unstereotyping influencer brand content
To help strip out stereotypes, we’ve worked with influencers to co-create a new guide: 10 Ways to Unstereotype Influencer Brand Content (PDF 6.6 MB).
Developed with support from the Diversity Standards Collective, this open-sourced guide offers advice to help influencers share a more authentic reflection of themselves and the world around them in their branded content. But it’s not exclusively for influencers working with Unilever. We want to make it available to any influencer working with any brand, so it’s freely available to download.
Laura, who posts on Instagram as @RelightAlopecia, is one of the influencers we worked with to create the guide. She has alopecia, a condition that has led to the loss of her hair, and she shares the experiences and challenges that brings with her audience.
Laura says: “I’m really encouraged that Unilever is gathering insights from creators, like me, with lived experience of discrimination on set and social media due to our differences and disabilities. Being bald should never have been a barrier to me pursuing dreams of being on camera. And now, years later, with a guide like this, those in positions of influence within the industry will ensure it no longer is.”
Sara Denby, Head of the Unstereotype Alliance Secretariat, UN Women, adds: “We wholeheartedly support this new chapter in Unilever’s Act 2 Unstereotype journey to eradicate harmful stereotypes from branded content and think it is a timely and important initiative.
“As influencers become increasingly central to brands looking to connect with their audiences in an authentic, meaningful manner, it is vital that we support them – and ourselves as businesses – to ensure we’re working together to create brilliant, creative and, most importantly, unstereotypical content for all.”

text Matt Close was appointed President of Unilever’s Ice Cream Business Group in April 2022. Before this he was EVP for Global Ice Cream for six years. He navigated ice cream through three tough Covid years by accelerating quick commerce, digitalising out-of-home as much as possible and stepping up premium innovation to bring joy to people’s homes, delivering smiles even when the world had to stay indoors.
Career and leadership
Matt, have you always worked in ice cream?
Mostly, yes. I joined Birds Eye Wall’s, Unilever’s frozen food and ice cream company, as part of Unilever’s Future Leaders Programme in 1992. I did various ice cream roles for the first 11 years. I then spent eight years leading Personal Care and Home Care in the UK & Ireland before coming back home to Ice Cream in 2011. I have 22 ice cream summers under my belt now and have led the business for the past seven.
What attracted you to working at Unilever?
It was and remains an unparalleled learning environment. I have always been attracted to our mission to prove that sustainable business can be a driver of competitive, consistently high performance. That’s certainly a factor and something I still hold dear.
What do you find most rewarding about your job?
My job is about delivering happiness. We talk about happy people for a happy planet, winning smiles. As the world’s largest ice cream company, we’ve spent the last 100 years bringing happiness through ice cream around the world. In 2022 we created 28 billion smiles with consumers, where they enjoyed an ice cream – that’s a whole lot of joy!
We believe in creating an unbroken chain of happiness across our value chain – making and selling ice cream in even more sustainable ways for a happy planet. That’s at the heart of how I lead and the difference I can make.
How would you describe your leadership style?
I’m a ‘people first’ leader. I truly believe that happier people deliver better performance and results.
I am very focused on having a clear strategy with real freedom in that strategic framework so we really liberate our talent to be engaged, fulfilled and able to thrive.
We have spent time codifying the culture we want in our ice cream business. It comes down to three pillars – caring for everyone, connecting people to people and making sure each team member feels truly valued.
In practice, that means a work environment where people want to work with and for each other, want to share stories of success but also failure, and where everyone feels safe to speak up about issues. I believe this enables us to make the business grow faster.
I’m also a marketer by training, so lavishing attention on making our brands distinctive and superior is at the heart of my leadership agenda. Building an unparalleled innovation machine is critical to winning in desire categories like ice cream. 
Strategy, innovation and growth
What key differences has Unilever’s reorganisation delivered?
The big change for us is the ability to focus on the domain expertise needed in a frozen category, so we can get to market faster, make quicker decisions and take more experimental risks.
The ice cream business has some unique properties. We are a desire category. Nobody absolutely needs an ice cream (well ok, sometimes you do!), but lots of people want one. And that means making sure the brands work hard to be emotionally relevant and resonant. 
Secondly, it doesn’t want to maintain its state. Ice cream wants to defrost. Having ice cream experts innovate at every step of the product lifecycle and take care of our products right through the cold chain allows us to deliver the best consumer experience.
Finally, it means we’re able to define our contribution to the company’s strategy as a singular ice cream business. How we get to net zero is very different from how other business groups will get there, and we’ve been able to call that out much more clearly.
What does it mean for decision-making and innovation?
We can focus on what makes the biggest difference to getting growth in ice cream.
One of our new business models is working to give digital tools to our customers to create better service for them. More than 2.5 million shopkeepers sell our ice cream. We are currently working to serve more than 1.4 million through digital tools, enabling them to order online and grow faster.
We have image capture technology inside nearly 50,000 ice cream cabinets right now. This uses AI to let shopkeepers know what to restock and submit orders in a frictionless way. It’s experimenting at scale to unlock growth the ice cream way. 
In the past we might have struggled to get attention for our specific suite of tools, but not anymore, because they’re very, very important to ice cream people.
I see ideas that help us sell more ice cream moving much more quickly into markets, and our dedicated teams are much more engaged in evolving our business model to be future-fit than ever before.
How is this generating value and growth?
In 2022 ice cream grew 9%. In much of the world, ice cream is a very seasonal business, so maximising the return on our investment is better served as a dedicated business group.
Being separate also allows us to spend more time working on deseasonalising the turnover, especially through a dedicated approach to what we call ‘Ice Cream NOW’. This sees us working with digital players to get ice cream to anyone, anywhere and at any time.
We have also put the levers of growth and investment in the hands of our frontline teams. I’m much more confident that we can deliver our full potential as a business group by helping our people spend more time on what makes the biggest difference to the business and make the right trade-offs within ice cream to deliver overall value creation.
What does this mean for your markets?
In very simple terms, I approach the world through three clusters.
In the US, our big focus is on premiumisation and digital commerce, in a market that has the highest per capita consumption in the world. Focusing on Ben & Jerry’s, Talenti and Magnum is key while modernising our famous mainstream brands like Breyers, Klondike and Popsicle. Proven growth drivers are delivering distinctively superior experiences for the consumer and enabling them to order whenever they want.
In Europe, we have the same premiumisation focus with our true indulgence brands, Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s. We also want to be known for flawless execution of a brilliant out-of-home business to make sure we win those impulse moments.
In the emerging markets, we see it as our responsibility to develop the market by having a portfolio across the full price range, by being worth it and by being the best marketers.
It’s also about getting every freezer cabinet right. We call this the DAVE way, where the stock in every cabinet is: Desirable, Available, Visible and Executed brilliantly. We have great repeatable models from markets like Turkey, Mexico, China and Thailand that help us win everywhere.
What does it mean for the business’s progress to net zero?
Ice cream is around 12% of Unilever’s turnover and 20% of its greenhouse gas footprint.
We have a robust plan in place to reach net zero by 2039 by focusing on what I call our four Cs – cabinets, cows, cocoa and circularity.
The two most important ones from an emissions point of view are cows and cabinets.
Last year we started to work with 17 dairy cooperatives in the US and in the Netherlands to prove that we can reduce farm greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and we’ve started to see good initial results.
We also finished 2022 with our plant-based ice cream business representing 8% of ice cream’s turnover, so we’re making a big contribution to Unilever’s commitment to a €1.5 billion plant-based business by 2025.
Our goal for our fleet of ice cream freezer cabinets is to use green energy and less energy. In Germany, we have just completed a trial raising freezer temperatures from -18°C to -12°C, which could be a big contribution and required deep domain expertise to keep our product quality. Over the course of a three-month summer season, each of the cabinets used 25% less energy, which is a massive downscale on emissions.
With all of these initiatives, we always make sure we continue to deliver what the consumer expects, which is amazingly indulgent gorgeous products. There is no point in compromising the product experience for sustainability. This is our ‘and, and’ challenge. 
Are there any brand examples that you would like to call on to illustrate that progress?
Ben & Jerry’s really typifies the sort of impact that we want to have.
It’s a brand that was born of dairy but is already a leader in the plant-based ice cream market in the US. And it’s achieved this while embarking on a radical programme dedicated to working with farmers to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions on their farms and for our products.
Trends and results
Are you pleased with Ice Cream’s results so far in 2023?
I’m pleased with the step-up in the quality of our execution.
I know that our grip in out-of-home is going up. I know our total distribution points for premium ice cream brands such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s are improving. I know our money is going behind fewer, more focused activities, because we’re measuring them.
I hate being the ice cream guy complaining about the weather but the start to the year has been colder and wetter than any we remember. It’s been decidedly unseasonal in many markets. The truth is a bit of good weather does help us. But ice cream people are optimistic, and the year is only getting going.
And as I’ve said, deseasonalising ice cream is a big part of our strategy. It’s always 20⁰C at home at 9pm on the sofa and our Ice Cream NOW programme, which looks to deliver ice cream to anyone, anytime and anywhere, has been phenomenally successful over the past four years, so we will continue to drive that.
Looking to the future
Are there any markets and channels that you are focusing on for growth?
Growth comes from really sharp execution of strategy by people who feel cared for and in turn care.
We expect our emerging markets to grow fastest as we drive market development, and we know that’s possible because we’ve been doing it for a long time.
Digital commerce will be critical. And we expect our out-of-home channel to be a big growth driver for ice cream, partly as we continue to recover from three horrible years of Covid, but also because we’re putting more focus on digitalising how shopkeepers manage their business.
The rest of Unilever has a bigger emerging markets footprint so while we will grow fast, I cannot overemphasise the role our very big markets play. It is critical for us to keep innovating and modernising in the US and Europe to achieve our vision.
Consumers want us to thrill and delight them and customers want us to prove we have category growth management in mind.
You have also stated your ambition for Cornetto to join Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s as a €1 billion brand. How bullish are you in terms of when that is going to happen?
With a good tailwind, it’s stretching but possible for Cornetto to get there this year. It’s game on for a big summer!
To make it happen we need everyone to keep a laser-sharp focus on the brand, starting with the amazing work our factories do to deliver outstanding quality in every cone.
We’ve given Cornetto more priority for the first time in seven years and have pivoted to bringing scale innovation to the brand right across the globe.
How will Ice Cream continue to grow sustainably?
Growing sustainably comes from a deep understanding of what consumers are looking for and meeting their needs better than our competitors.
To do that well, we need to leverage the global scale of brands like Magnum, Ben and Jerry’s and Cornetto, while making more of brands like Wall’s and Twister.
But sustainability obviously has a double meaning nowadays.
Consumers expect us to be moving away from plastic and recently we took our European ice cream tubs for Carte D’Or out of plastic and into recyclable paper.
They expect us to treat everyone in the supply chain fairly, and Magnum is working with cocoa and vanilla partners to make sure that there’s no deforestation or child labour in the system and that our farmers are able to achieve a living income.
It’s also about how we responsibly make our products. For all our ice creams, we’re committed to:
95% of packaged ice cream containing no more than 22g total sugar per serving by 2025
95% of packaged ice cream containing no more than 250 kcal per serving by 2025.
And we have even stricter criteria for our kids’ portfolio.
The challenge for our marketers is to tell all these stories in a way that makes our brands more appealing than competitive offerings. Our R&D folks have a big role to play too.
What do you think are the next big trends in ice cream? And what can we expect from Unilever in these spaces?
There are three. The first one is ever present and ever enduring – being unapologetically indulgent.
The second is around understanding the occasions where ice cream is most relevant so we can design new formats that really deliver against those occasions. We’ve seen stellar growth on all mini formats, especially Magnum Mini over the past eight years and minification will continue to be important.
The third is the ‘better for you’ space, be it plant-based, lower-sugar or diet-specific (but still great-tasting) ice creams. These are all areas that we’re actively innovating in and driving growth through right now.
And finally…
If you had the chance to ask a fellow business group leader a question, who would you ask and what would that question be?
I would ask my friend Richard Slater, our Chief R&D Officer, how we can make our packaging more circular.
text At Unilever, our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps we’re taking to reach our climate targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations by 100% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.
Vivek Nesarikar 
In a series of interviews, we put the spotlight on some of the people who are helping to deliver our action plan and make change happen.
Vivek Nesarikar, our Global Engineering Manager for heating technologies is based in Mumbai, India, and has been with Unilever for 11 years. Here he explains how we’re using waste heat energy to help lower our operational emissions.
What does Unilever use thermal energy for?
As well as providing heat and hot water in our factories, thermal energy sources can be used during production processes, like pasteurisation for our ice cream, and for cleaning processing equipment in our machinery (known as CIP – Cleaning in Place).
In our operations, thermal energy use accounts for most of our carbon footprint. When we develop decarbonisation roadmaps for our sites, thermal electrification – either through heat pumps, electric boilers or a combination of both – is emerging as a common solution.
In total, over a third of our thermal energy use is currently drawn from renewable sources. To meet our target of achieving 100% renewable heat by 2030, we will be looking to significantly increase our use of heat pumps across our operations.
Biomass is energy created using material from forests or farming, biomethane is gas produced through the breakdown of agricultural residue or gases from landfill, and biodiesel is a diesel formed from plant oils or fats.
What is heat pump technology and how do we use it?
Heat pumps allow us to capture cooler (low grade), waste heat in our factories and use compression to convert it into hotter (high grade) heat that we can then reuse in our manufacturing. For one unit of electricity consumption, we can get three to four units of useful heat.
There are two main types of heat pumps – water source and air source. We use both within our operations. For example, in some of our factories, we’re using water source heat pumps to recycle waste heat produced by our air compressors, chillers, and ammonia systems, saving us money and energy. When a waste heat source is not available nearby, then we deploy air source heat pumps.
What challenges do we face as we work towards 100% renewable thermal energy by 2030?
We’ve looked at almost all the available renewable energy sources and there are challenges with many of them. Green (renewable) hydrogen is expensive and won’t be a viable solution at scale before 2030. Geothermal technology is a very site-specific solution and solar thermal is restricted by the space availability at the site. That’s why heat recovery combined with a heat pump, supported by an electric boiler, is the technology we currently favour. It is a proven and reliable solution which can provide uninterrupted heat.
That said, most of our sites are currently using steam, so switching to use heat recovery and heat pump technology means shifting from steam to hot water, which requires a lot of modification to our existing energy distribution networks. Making all these changes in an existing operating factory is complex and can be expensive.
How can we overcome these challenges?
Working out how our targets can be achieved without incurring extra operational costs, or potentially in a way that even makes savings, is a key part of our plans to adopt renewable thermal energy. It’s worth noting that although investing in a heat pump is more expensive than an electric boiler initially, the operating cost is much lower.
We also need to ensure there are other technologies in place to support the heat pumps, such as electric boilers or solar thermal. At Unilever, we make products in batches, so our demand for heat goes up at certain points in the production cycle, then it stops, meaning heat demand regularly fluctuates. Heat pumps are not like boilers in terms of their ability to respond immediately when demand ramps up. We use heat demand pattern studies to ensure we can cater to peak loads.
How are we working with different Business Groups to switch to renewable thermal energy?
The good thing is most of our processes need heating and cooling subsequently, which helps us in our aim of creating circular energy in our factories, recovering and recycling heat, removing the need for external heat supplies. However, the percentage of captured or recovered heat versus our heat demand varies from 30% to 100% depending on which product category we are talking about. At Personal Care sites, it’s about 30% to 35%; in Ice Cream sites, it can be 95% to 100%.
Our Home Care detergent towers need air that’s heated to around 400°C. Heat pumps are not designed to deliver air that hot, so at present, we have to fall back on options like biogenics to meet that demand. In these cases, we’ve taken steps to ensure that the biofuels we use come from sustainable local sources in line with Unilever’s policy on biofuels (PDF 110.51 KB), and we will also continue to work on longer-term solutions.
What kind of innovative approaches are we taking?
So far, we have developed the know-how for capitalising on almost all types of waste heat from our processes and utilities, through air compressors, cooling towers, and ammonia systems combined with heat pumps. Now, we’re actively working with factories to develop fully integrated energy systems that also include renewable energy solutions, such as solar and geothermal, to achieve 100% thermal energy decarbonisation.
We have trialled integrating heat pump technology with an existing solar thermal system in one of our Personal Care factories in Dubai to provide an energy boost during the night when there is obviously no sun. It resulted in a further 16% reduction in gas consumption, so we’re keen to keep experimenting with the idea of combining heat pumps with other technologies.
We’re also working on recovering heat from wastewater treatment plants with specially designed heat exchangers. We’re exploring ways we could create heat pump solutions to provide 120°C hot water and steam, which will unlock many opportunities without altering existing processes.
We’re using digital tools to improve energy efficiency, such as Internet of Things (IoT) control devices and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify changes in production on the factory floor, acting on sources of waste heat, or shutting down machines when they’re not needed.
Is there anywhere that we’re really leading the field?
One project that is pushing boundaries is our work testing biodiesel in backup diesel generators. Most of our factories have a diesel generator that acts as a backup if there is an interruption in electricity from the grid.
Because we use a specially formulated second-generation (non-food sourced) biodiesel, we’ve been able to gradually increase the percentage we’re using, from 10% up to 20%, and we’ve even run successful trials for using 100% biodiesel. And because we’ve ensured the quality of our biodiesel is so high, we’re now planning to roll it out to all our Indian sites as a next step. As far as we know, nobody else has managed to make a 100% switch yet, so that’s something we’re really pleased to be doing.
One of my key responsibilities is bringing innovative solutions to the business and I’m very proud that we’re deploying the latest technologies wherever possible. We know that in order to reach our climate targets, we need to make big and bold changes. I work for the moments when I help provide solutions that will 100% decarbonise a factory, because we know we need to deliver results fast, and we’re working hard to make that happen.
text When it comes to bouncing back better, Unilever Food Solutions’ two-year turnaround is a case study in crisis management, agility and teamwork.
With a business model anchored to supplying the food service sector, it was inevitable that UFS would be hit hard by the pandemic lockdowns. But nothing could have prepared the business for overnight losses of 70% with no sense of when things might pick up.
Today, UFS has surpassed pre-pandemic volume levels, with a huge reserve of customer loyalty and a B2B digital selling platform which has seen impressive growth both in terms of volume and reach.
Lockdown Lessons
“Right from the first day of lockdown, the whole team was constantly thinking: ‘How can we protect the business and how can we protect P&L (Profit & Loss)?” remembers Star Chen, EVP, Unilever Food Solutions.
Whether it was helping businesses simplify their menus to meet the needs of delivery platforms or suggesting new products that would tolerate transit better, UFS made it clear from the very start of the lockdowns, that they were standing shoulder to shoulder with their customers through the pandemic.
“We started with little things like putting chefs in touch with delivery platforms, or helping them redistribute their waste through social enterprise organisations like Too Good to Go,” says Star. “But in the end, I think these are the things that will give us the biggest returns. We have huge customer loyalty.”
In lockdown, digital offered the only way to really fulfil the requirements of the chefs and restaurants we work with.
Star Chen, EVP, Unilever Food Solutions
Transforming the toolkit
However, for a business that was used to a face-to-face sales model, successfully continuing to serve customers during lockdown demanded a pivot to working online.
“We knew creating our digital capability platform was the first thing we had to do because fundamentally we are not just B2B (business-to-business), we are also P2P (people-to-people),” says Star.
“We work with chefs and restaurants that have specific requirements. In lockdown, digital offered the only way to really fulfil these requirements, as well as sharing data and advice with our consumers and our sales team.”
Although it was already in the pipeline, the digital transformation was fast-tracked and developed in record time following these four pillars:
Route to market: Operators were moved to eCommerce platforms with the creation of 27 online shops.
Digital sales: Sales reps were empowered with a made-to-measure digital app that increased productivity and reached more operators.
Data: Research and results were consolidated into a data hub, providing all sales reps with critical, at-a-glance customer view and intelligent data insights.
Independent marketing: 54 markets were empowered to send out their campaigns independently, resulting in 14 million emails being sent a year (compared to 4 million the year before), with no agency costs and with higher open and click-through rates.
Changing mindsets through training and support
However, getting the tech in place was only part of the puzzle. For a sales team that was used to a face-to-face sales model, switching to online meant a complete change of mindset.
“We knew we had to convince our sales team that the work they had previously done face to face could also be done digitally via remote support,” remembers Star.
“We created a remote customer visit process and invited chefs to join the call from their kitchens.”
And the demands on chefs did not end there.
The shift to a virtual world meant chefs were now asked to act as online influencers available 24/7 to support customers.
It is a role many took on enthusiastically and very successfully, thanks to UFS-created influencer guidelines and training.
Today, over 200 UFS chefs are still sharing information about products and recipes to more than 3.2 million social media followers, and thereby contributing to growth both in market reach and penetration.
Upskilling for sales growth
“But great ideas need landing gear as well as wings,” remarks Harpreet Sethi, UFS Global Head of Technology, explaining the critical role the online tuition modules provided by UFS played in empowering the team. “We created over 60 learning courses to upskill the local market experts and encourage them to use technology to drive business growth,” he says.
Today, more than 80% of the UFS sales team are now trained in digital sales. “This has led to significant productivity gains, with virtual meetings addressing the needs of twice as many operators with twice the strike rate than face to face,” says Harpreet. “All this has led to better GTM (go-to-market) productivity.”
And the numbers show it. In 2022, UFS’s value index reached 112% compared to its value in 2019. And conversion rates have also increased, in part, thanks to the introduction of the new UFS digital sales app which now covers 24 markets allowing 2000+ registered third-party reps to reach over 50,000 operators.
Leveraging digital data power
With results like these, it’s clear that the digital model is here to stay for UFS, especially as it also supports one of the key assets for the business: its proximity to user needs.
“Our business model means that we have always been very close to the users of our products, and to the market,” says Star. “Now we also benefit from the data collected from the digital platform, which combined with the data from our sales team, gives us incredible insight and puts us in a unique position to prepare for future menus in a credible way.
So what is on the menu for UFS?
“The top priority is to become the market leader in digital selling in the foodservice industry,” says Star with a smile, adding that they will approach this goal in the same way as they approach everything: by listening to their chefs.
text Jostein Solheim became CEO of our Health & Wellbeing business in 2021, after more than three decades at Unilever, including eight years as CEO of Ben & Jerry’s.
Now four years old, the Health & Wellbeing Collective sits within Unilever’s Beauty & Wellbeing business group – a €12 billion global division.
Jostein Solheim, CEO of Unilever’s Health & Wellbeing business 
Jostein, how would you introduce the Health & Wellbeing Collective?
It’s a €1 billion+ portfolio of seven fast-growing lifestyle brands disrupting the industry at the convergence of scientific credibility, personalisation, and transparency. We’ve got:
Liquid I.V. (Opens in a pop-up window ) – the No.1 powdered hydration brand in the US *
OLLY (Opens in a pop-up window ) – America’s No.1 gummy vitamin brand **
Nutrafol (Opens in a pop-up window ) – the No.1 dermatologist-recommended hair growth supplement brand in the US ***
SmartyPants Vitamins (Opens in a pop-up window ) – the No.1 gummy multivitamin brand on Amazon and in the Natural channel, known for transparency in ingredients and science ****
Onnit (Opens in a pop-up window ) – an authority on nootropics/brain supplements in the US *****
Equilibra (Opens in a pop-up window ) – an Italian wellness brand specialising in natural ingredients
Welly (Opens in a pop-up window ) – a disruptor in the first-aid category with flex fabric bandages designed to stay on through playtime
Our brands are growing consistently – we reported 10.2% growth in Q1 2023, our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit, volume-led growth, and we contributed over €1 billion in turnover in 2022.
Health and wellbeing have always been priorities for Unilever. Ever since the business was established over 100 years ago, we’ve set out to improve people’s lives through brands powered by purpose and innovation.
Now the health and wellbeing industry is going through a cultural shift, transforming from its clinical roots into a lifestyle-led category, fitting right into Unilever’s sweet spot.
The Health & Wellbeing Collective reported another quarter of double-digit growth for Q1 2023. What were some of the success stories behind the numbers?
Across our portfolio, 100% of our brands are growing. That’s an achievement, but what makes it particularly strong is that the health and wellness market is still experiencing short-term lapping after a surge during Covid. The market has slowed down a bit but our brands are growing rapidly.
Some of our Q1 highlights include our latest acquisition, Nutrafol, the No.1 dermatologist-recommended hair growth supplement brand in the US, launching in prestige beauty retailer Sephora.
SmartyPants Vitamins introduced its most innovative launch to date – Sugar Free Multi & Omega gummies that are completely free from sugar alcohols.
Onnit just launched Alpha Brain Pre-Workout, designed to help charge up both the mind and body ahead of exercise.
And Liquid I.V. delivered very strong growth while announcing the next phase in its Clean Water Grants purpose programme, to invest $1.3 million in grants to non-profit partners.
Across our portfolio, 100% of our brands are growing.
What has made Unilever’s portfolio so resilient despite a short-term dip in the health and wellbeing sector? 
Despite the short-term challenges, we anticipate continued long-term market growth. Our model and our future-fit brands are uniquely positioned to win.
Our presence is particularly strong in high-growth spaces and formats such as gummies, powders, functional hydration, sleep, beauty from within, women’s health, kids’ health, and super ingredients such as probiotics.
We also have a portfolio of digitally native brands that are driving great results in ecommerce channels. Our business contribution from ecommerce is 1.6x the category average and it’s getting bigger.
It sounds like ecommerce is thriving, but the brands are expanding their reach in bricks and mortar stores too?
Absolutely. More than 50% of growth in this category is projected to come from ecommerce and we’re in a great place with our brands. They’re established in digital and direct-to-consumer channels and very connected to their users so they can understand what they want and need.
Social media is big for our brands too and the power of being digitally native is that our brands can inform, educate and engage with followers – they have stories to tell and endorsement from a community of consumers who love the products is incredibly powerful. Onnit has almost 1 million followers on Instagram. (Opens in a pop-up window )
But it’s not all about online. We’re unlocking further growth through traditional stores too – like Sephora for Nutrafol. It’s the brand’s largest retail expansion to date and an important step as it reshapes the hair health category.
Having a presence in stores and building relationships with retailers is a real strength of Unilever.
All the brands in the Health & Wellbeing Collective were acquired. How has being part of Unilever helped them grow?
When we acquired our brands, most of them were around seven years old. Three years later, at the age of ten, their sales have more than doubled. That’s proof that our model works.
This is a very young, entrepreneurial business and every brand in the Collective was very carefully chosen because they’re brilliant at what they do. As Unilever, we don’t get in their way. Instead, we support in areas like sales, analytics, ecommerce and talent to help them evolve and scale up.
For example, when we acquired Liquid I.V. it had 40 people. Now a team of 160 work on the brand and in terms of turnover, it’s four times larger than it was prior to our acquisition.
So what makes Unilever Health & Wellbeing different from competitors?
We have a very focused, very sharp approach when it comes to our vitamins, minerals and supplements business. Health as a lifestyle is what Unilever knows well, and we’re staying within that as a boundary.
As people shift from thinking about health as the absence of disease to seeing it as a more positive, proactive lifestyle pursuit, then health and wellbeing starts to encompass so much more – and that’s where we are so strong.
We’re growing our business by bringing together a group of companies that remain 100% focused on serving their customers and consumers, while being able to unlock scale benefits through the power of Unilever. And we understand the importance of science-based products, growing our impact in the world and retaining an entrepreneurial spirit.
Our ambition is to become a €3 billion business in the next few years.
And finally, how would you like to see the Health & Wellbeing Collective continue to grow?
Our ambition is to become a €3 billion business in the next few years. With the organic growth trajectory that we’re seeing in the US, the new innovations in the pipeline, and the work we’re doing to increase awareness, penetration and availability, I’m feeling very confident.
Our OLLY and SmartyPants Vitamins brands are in China and we have a dedicated team on the ground there to build that part of the business. Nutrafol has just become our third brand to reach China, launching on 24 May, less than a year after acquisition.
And of course we’re keeping an eye on expansion into other parts of the world too. The demand is certainly there. Health and wellbeing is a global mega-trend, so I hope we can build on the growth we’ve seen in the US across many other markets.
And I think there’s always an opportunity to explore new acquisitions in high-growth, benefit-led spaces. I’m sure there are a few companies that would fill the remaining gaps in our portfolio.
text The terms ‘global warming’ and ‘climate change’ are often used interchangeably. But though they share many similarities, they are slightly different things.
Understanding these subtle differences can help all of us plan the climate action we need to take in order to build a safer, more hospitable planet for the future.
Read on for definitions of both global warming and climate change – and to find out how we’re taking action within Unilever and across our value chain.
Understanding global warming
The term ‘global warming’ refers directly to the process of the Earth’s average surface temperature rising. The temperature of the Earth’s climate has always changed slightly, but in the past 50 years, and particularly the last 30, these changes have accelerated rapidly.
Why? It’s down to changes in a process commonly known as the greenhouse effect. Certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the Sun, making our home planet a comfortable place to live. But when excess amounts of these greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere, temperatures begin to shift.
There is overwhelming evidence, including a 97% scientific consensus, that global warming is largely a man-made problem. Rising temperatures have been caused by excessive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions accumulating in the atmosphere. These emissions have been created by a combination of factors, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas, deforestation and agriculture.
The Paris Agreement is a collective global agreement, signed at COP21 in 2015, to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C, and ideally, to 1.5°C. But we are currently on track for a rise of 2.7°C. If this happens, it will probably cause the loss of the planet’s vital ice sheets, causing sea levels to rise.
We’ll also experience severe weather conditions, food and freshwater shortages, and resulting conflict and migration which will make the Earth increasingly inhospitable for all of us.
The definition of climate change
‘Climate change’ is the result of global warming. It refers to significant changes in the Earth’s climate system which can lead to extreme weather patterns, causing wildfires, desert expansions and rising sea levels.
Humans, as well as Earth’s animals and plant life, naturally rely on the climate to be able to survive. As the effects of climate change become more extreme, people will be at risk of severe and unpredictable weather changes, which could cause more frequent natural disasters like cyclones, flooding, droughts and heatwaves.
Many animals are also at significantly increased risk of extinction, which could disrupt our connected ecosystems. A lot of these concerns are starting to happen right now, and will only get worse unless we work together to prevent them.
As shown above, global warming and climate change are different terms, though each shares the same uncertain results for the planet.
We think it makes sense to use the term ‘global warming’ to refer to the man-made causes of temperature change, like carbon emissions and deforestation.
Climate change should then be seen as the problems caused by this rise in temperature, like extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels.
The key similarity between these two terms is that both of them are man-made problems that we need to work collectively to prevent.
What is Unilever doing to address global warming and climate change?
Decarbonisation is one of the vital ways in which we can work towards preventing global warming and climate change in the future.
At Unilever, we’re working to decarbonise our business and remain on track to reduce our operational (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline, having already lowered them by 68%.
And we’re going beyond our own operations to address our Scope 3 emissions too – those across our value chain. Our targets include halving the emissions impact of our products per consumer use by 2030 against a 2010 baseline, and reaching net zero in our value chain by 2039. Decarbonisation is one of the vital ways in which we can work towards preventing global warming and climate change in the future.
No one business can reach net zero alone – which is why we’re working with others, through our Supplier Climate Programme and our Climate & Nature Fund, and calling for wider society to move on climate too.
There’s a lot we need to do, but having these clear targets in place has helped us track progress and continue to work towards defined goals.
Businesses today, be they global, national or regional, should have a clearly defined climate action plan in place to help slow both global warming and climate change in the future. We believe that a net zero emissions world is within reach, and we all have a role to play, but it’s the responsibility of governments and companies to lead us there.
text There are hundreds of different species of bacteria living in and on our bodies – an estimated 40 trillion microbes in fact – and most of these live in our gut. 
Collectively, they are known as the gut microbiome. They have a significant impact on our digestion, our immune system and the health of our entire body, including the brain, our muscles and our bones. They can even influence our mood.
“We all have a gut microbiome which is unique to us, so selecting a single marker of health is difficult,” says Robert Dixon, Unilever’s Science and Technology Manager for the gut microbiome.
“But what we can say, regardless of this variation between individuals, is that a diverse microbiome is the best marker of a healthy microbiome. And a healthy microbiome will keep your body functioning at its optimum.”
Working to diversify diets
Findings from the American Gut Project, the world’s largest citizen science microbiome project, show that people who eat more than 30 different plant-based foods a week have a more diverse, and therefore healthier, microbiome than those who eat ten or fewer.
“One of the best ways we can ensure we maintain the diversity of our gut microbiome is to eat a wide range of fruit and vegetables,” says Dr. Dixon. And yet many people struggle to eat the five-a-day portion of fruit and vegetables that WHO recommends. 
For example, a 2021 Veg Facts survey of eating habits in the UK found only 33% of adults and just 12% of 11–18-year-olds currently manage to hit that daily target.
This is just one of the reasons why Unilever R&D, Nutrition and Ice Cream are working to create products that make it easier for people to eat and enjoy a more plant-based diet.
“They say variety is the spice of life and that is also true for the microbes that live in your gut,” says Dr. Dixon. “Why not give some of our plant-based recipes a try? Your microbiome deserves it.”
Three ways to eat more veg and grow good gut bacteria
Easy and delicious plant-based recipes to kickstart Veganuary
Add more fibre with beans and legumes
While chickpeas or broccoli might not be ingredients that often make an appearance at mealtimes, adding them to a soup, chilli or casserole is a great way to diversify your vegetable intake and add fibre to your diet.
“Diets that are high in fibre and polyphenols maintain the diversity of our gut microbiomes,” says Dr. Dixon. “While the human part of our guts can’t digest them, they are a rich source of food for our gut bacteria, who all prefer to eat different things.” 
Why not try Knorr’s Moroccan style-lentil and vegetable stew or Hellmann’s creamy broccoli pasta?
Ramp up your prebiotic intake with a boost of berries
Prebiotics are good for the gut microbiome because they act like a microbial fertiliser, stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria. 
The good news is prebiotics are found in many fruits and vegetables. Blueberries, for example, are an excellent source of fibre and polyphenols, making them healthy for both you and your gut microbiome.
Why not try Hellmann’s blueberry crisp using Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise or enjoy a decadent weekend treat with a Magnum Vegan morning smoothie bowl?
Add some sweet and sour flavours with fermented veg
Research shows that different types of fermented food such as sauerkraut, kefir and kimchi contain different types of microbes, so eating a diversity of fermented foods can also be beneficial. 
They’re also a rich source of beneficial microbes which may improve our microbiome function and help restore the microbiome to good health if it’s been compromised.
And while the strong pickled flavour of kimchi might not be appealing on its own, it’s a great ingredient in noodle dishes and stir-fries.
Why not try Korean Peckers from The Vegetarian Butcher?
text Unilever and Arzeda have developed new enzymes with increased stability, performance and sustainability benefits in just 18 months – that’s five times faster than previously possible.
The milestone in our multi-year partnership was achieved using the company’s Intelligent Protein Design Technology. This combines physics-based design and artificial intelligence (AI) to create new proteins and enzymes that fight stains better, use less water and energy, and replace petrochemical-derived ingredients.
In fact, these new enzymes, which have an impressive ability to break down different types of stains, could halve the number of ingredients we need to formulate our cleaning and laundry products.
The Arzeda partnership supports our Clean Future strategy, which is how we’re transforming some of the most popular cleaning and laundry brands in the world to become lower carbon and lower waste, with the same or even better performance.
“As part of Unilever’s Clean Future strategy, we’re investing in cutting-edge technologies to develop the next generation of sustainable, high-performance cleaning products,” says Peter ter Kulve, Unilever Home Care President. “The progress made in just 18 months with Arzeda’s technology shows how the convergence of AI and biology is a game-changer for an industry like home care.”
Since beginning work with Unilever in July 2021, Arzeda has been responsible for the design, strain engineering and initial scale-up of the new enzymes. Production in real-world testing quantities has been completed, demonstrating that the new enzymes can be used within our portfolio.
The progress with Arzeda’s technology shows how the convergence of AI and biology is a game-changer.
“As we continue to scale up production, we’re extremely excited and optimistic about the incredible potential this partnership has for consumers and our planet,” adds Arzeda CEO and founder Alexandre Zanghellini.
The partnership will also advance our commitment to reach net zero emissions from all our products by 2039.
text Reginaldo Ecclissato’s history with Unilever spans 32 years, eight countries and a wide variety of roles. Since being named Chief Business Operations and Supply Chain Officer in 2022, Reginaldo has leveraged the combined power of technology, teamwork, data and partnerships to create an award-winning supply chain that is sustainable, effective and resilient from the first mile of production to the last.
Career and Leadership
Have you always worked in supply chain operations?
I’ve spent the majority of my career working within operations. After graduating as an electrical engineer, I started as a supply chain trainee with Unilever back in 1991. Since then, I’ve been fortunate to have worked in both developed and emerging markets in eight different countries. I’ve had a range of roles, from overseeing the construction of a new factory and the production of powder detergents in Brazil to leadership positions with responsibility for North, Latin and Central America.
What first attracted you to working at Unilever?
I was initially attracted to Unilever because of the company’s strong values which aligned with my own, as well as the opportunity to develop a global career, which was quite unusual 30 years ago.
What do you find most rewarding about the work you do?
I take immense pride in the fact that over my 32-year career, I’ve consistently prioritised mentoring individuals who can step into leadership roles and drive positive change. It has been a rewarding experience to witness the growth and success of those I’ve had the privilege to mentor.
How would you describe your leadership style?
I would say I’m an accessible leader who is both demanding and supportive. I believe in maintaining open lines of communication, creating an environment where my team feels comfortable approaching me with any questions, concerns or ideas they may have.
I also hold high expectations for my team and strive for excellence in our work. I firmly believe that setting challenging goals and pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve is essential for growth and success.
By combining such high expectations with a supportive approach, I aim to inspire and motivate my team to achieve their goals while fostering a collaborative and positive work environment.
Strategy, Innovation and Growth
Unilever has, for the 5th year in a row, been recognised by Gartner in its exclusive Masters category in Supply Chain Top 25 ranking. What do you think secured Unilever’s inclusion on the list this year?
It’s down to the ongoing dedication and hard work of our Business Operations teams, from Procurement and Customer Operations to everything in between.
I’m incredibly proud to be part of this world-class organisation, as we continue to embed a new internal structure while negotiating external challenges such as high inflation and the war in Ukraine. We’re offering our Business Groups both best-in-class and segmented services, fully leveraging the benefits of scale, cutting-edge technology, and strong central expertise.
I would say our long-term partnerships continue to be a key part of our success too. We’re leveraging technology for sustainability through major suppliers while also working with many small to medium-sized providers. And I cannot overplay the significance of the work we’re doing with suppliers of raw materials and ingredients to lower our climate impact.
Do you feel a new post-Covid normal has been established, despite the global challenges that have followed?
Covid-19 was a reminder to expect the unexpected and to prioritise investing in resilience and agility in our value chain. At the start of the pandemic, through our partner Scoutbee, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technology to find new collaborative manufacturers quickly in a safe and assured way.
Also during Covid, at our factories in Indaiatuba in Brazil and Guayas in Ecuador, we combined remote control and automation with advanced analytics and machine learning, allowing engineers and technicians to use the data generated by the towers’ algorithm to make strategic decisions around production from home.
Continuing to build resilience to avoid supply shortages is essential given the current economic and political context in which we’re operating, and we can expect more of the same as climate change impacts take hold. It’s the normal way of doing things now.
Business Operations is a driver of sustainable growth for the company. What will the priorities be for the function as we look to the years ahead?
We spent the last year rolling out our new organisational structure, so our focus now is firmly on delivering sustainable 4G growth for our Business Groups by driving superiority vs competition. That means growth that is consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible. It means a faster than ever roll-out of innovations and improvements and working closely with our Business Groups to move ahead with decarbonisation and sustainability.
Technology and Data
In terms of Business Operations, how have technology and digital helped increase efficiency?
We’re using technology to transform our value chain – from how we source our ingredients and raw materials to the way we make, sell and distribute our products to customers.
For example, we’re using an innovative data-storing technology called Graph to help us more easily identify the risk of a supply shortage in a particular geography, and quickly switch to different suppliers. Graph also allows us to map the sustainability impact of our products and develop sustainable portfolio strategies.
In factories such as Tianjin in China, we’re using renewable energy sources controlled by a smart management system, which has reduced our electricity consumption by around a third, thereby increasing our operational efficiency. 
Port Sunlight in the UK is another good example. We’ve reduced our electricity use there by 10% by using Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor what’s happening on the factory floor in real time, sending that information to the Cloud, and alerting line leads to machines left on for two hours with no production.
And in logistics, our Virtual Ocean Control Tower is helping us to ensure we fill our containers more efficiently, sending automated alerts when capacity is below 60%, together with financial and CO2 impact. This system helped us save as much as €16 million in 2022.
What role does technology play in helping Unilever to deliver on its climate and nature commitments?
We’re seeing time and time again that investing in technology not only increases efficiency but also helps us deliver on climate and nature.
At our Dapada factory in India, machine learning and digital twin technology helped reduce energy consumption per tonne by 29% and emissions by 28% over the last four years. And downstream of our operations, the Virtual Ocean Control Tower I mentioned before helped us to reduce emissions from our shipments by about 15% in 2022 alone.
Upstream, together with Google and NGIS Australia (a leading provider of mapping technology), we’ve built geospatial capability enabling us to partner with data providers to have greater traceability and transparency in the first mile of our supply chain. Descartes Labs, for example, applies AI to satellite imagery to detect changes in forest cover and provides deforestation alerts that allow us to identify and act on that risk more rapidly.
How are we improving our data flow?
Something I’m particularly excited about is our work to gather carbon footprint data from suppliers for the products they sell to us, so we have a better understanding of our overall climate impact. We’ve standardised this data exchange, using an application programming interface (API) which allows suppliers to automatically share data in the same format, requiring only minimal processing resource on our end.
We’re also working with GreenToken by SAP, making use of blockchain to create and transfer virtual tokens for ingredients like palm oil that carry information about where ingredients were produced. Collecting this data helps us build a fuller picture of the relationships between mills, traders and farmers, and allows us to take actions to avoid deforestation.
Looking to the future
If we were to come back and speak to you in 2030, what particular highlights and tech innovations would you hope to be able to share with us?
Unilever has made a commitment to share the carbon footprint of every product we sell, and I want to be sure this information is both accurate and meaningful for consumers, so that it helps them compare products and make more sustainable choices when they shop. To get there, we need to keep increasing the exchange of real data across our supplier base, moving away from industry averages.
And by 2030, I want us to have maximised the positive impact we can have on both climate and nature, by finding ways for others in our value chain to also make use of helpful technologies. We want to use our influence for good, with the benefits going beyond the boundaries of our own business.
What challenges do you think we will face in the future and how will we overcome them?
Things are moving very quickly with technology and one challenge is making sure that we get our future-fit talent strategy right. So far, we have focused on upskilling our workforce and driving learning company-wide – including in our factories. We have seen that our employees want to learn about data and analytics, agile delivery and digital expertise.
When we get the tech right, we make magic happen. We see this day to day through our pioneering Lighthouse factories which are leading in technology and data-driven actions to become faster, more efficient, more effective and more automated.
Finally, if you could ask any other business leader at Unilever a question, what would it be?
I would ask Willem Uijen, Chief Procurement Officer, for his view on ‘Power of One and Focus of Five’ for procurement.
text After 38 years at Unilever, Alan Jope will be retiring at the end of June. His career has taken him from marketing trainee in 1985 to the company’s top job, which he has held for almost five years. It’s also given him the opportunity to live and work in many parts of the world – including China, Thailand and the US.
In this interview, he looks back on his time with Unilever, reflecting on some of the stand-out successes and main challenges, and why he believes the company is well positioned for its next phase of growth.
text How it started
In 1988, Langnese (Wall’s) in Germany began developing a product that would appeal to grown-up ice cream lovers, taking inspiration from one of its popular children’s ice cream sticks.
The team developed a handheld stick of delicious ice cream made from Madagascar vanilla and covered it with a luxurious coating designed by Belgian chocolate pioneers to provide a signature crack at first bite.
They called the new brand Magnum.
Officially launched in Germany in 1989, Magnum quickly went on to be sold in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
As President of Ice Cream Matt Close told CNN Business: “Unilever ‘got serious’ about ice cream when it launched Magnum. Suddenly, we moved from being a kind of kids’ seaside treat to something that people were eating in many more locations.”
How it’s going
Today, Magnum enjoys consistent, strong growth. It’s sold in more than 80 countries around the world and is a market-leading ice cream brand in Europe.
Creating a successful ice cream brand for ‘grown-ups’ opened up a new marketplace where flavour, indulgence and pleasure were key.
In 2017, cracking chocolate ice cream tubs were added to the portfolio with packaging specifically designed to encourage consumers to squeeze the tub before opening to hear the crack of the thick Magnum chocolate shell.
In 2018, vegan versions of Classic and Almond Magnums were launched with the promise of 100% pleasure. Both went on to win Best Ice Cream at the PETA Vegan Food Awards in 2019.
In 2019, the brand debuted its Double range crafted for ‘multiple layers of decadence’ in the US.
In 2020, Magnum introduced consumers to the world’s fourth flavour of chocolate – ruby chocolate. Made with ruby cocoa beans and gorgeously pink in colour, it was used to provide an indulgent coating to Magnum Ruby, featuring white chocolate ice cream enriched with a raspberry sauce swirl.
In 2021, the launch of Magnum Double Gold Caramel Billionaire followed, in a stick format and tub (and under 250 calories per serving). Described as “the most indulgent Magnum yet”, the team worked with global pop star Miley Cyrus to celebrate the fact that ‘pleasure has more than one layer’.
2022 saw Remixes of Magnum Classics with complementary combinations added to classic flavours, bringing attention to the brand from a new Gen Z consumer base (see below).
And there is more to come. Check out ‘Brand new ideas’ below for more of Magnum’s deliciously indulgent innovations.
The purpose that powers it
Magnum believes in creating products that allow people to indulge responsibly.
As part of its Cocoa Strategy, the brand aims to empower 5,000 women in cocoa farming communities, socially and economically, by 2025. As part of its AWA by Magnum, programme the brand is also investing €25 million in female-focused initiatives with NGO partners to reach this goal.
As a signatory to the Cocoa & Forests Initiative, Magnum has also publicly committed to eliminating deforestation and forest degradation and has pledged to plant 465,000 trees in the Ivory Coast .
In terms of ingredients, 100% of the vanilla extract comes from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms and over 98% of Magnum cocoa beans are sustainably sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms and the brand is working hard to make it 100% soon.
Magnum has worked hard to ensure that its packaging is sustainable too. Ice cream sticks are made from certified sustainable wood, its multi-pack cartons are made from recycled paper, and it was the first ice cream brand to use recycled polypropylene plastic in its tubs.
Brand new ideas
Magnum Minis 
Some 60% of Gen Z and millennials cannot get through the day without a snack. The launch of Magnum Vegan Minis provided consumers with an indulgent snack-sized ice cream and bite-sized introduction to a plant-based version of the brand. In 2023, two new products are being added to the range – Mini Double Caramel Almond and Magnum Mini Double Gold Caramel Billionaire which are both 161 calories per stick.
Magnum in the metaverse 
In June 2022 at Europe’s leading Metaverse festival, MET AMS in Amsterdam, Magnum unveiled its Magnum Pleasure Museum, showcasing original artwork from various creatives. It also simulated a future vending machine with quick commerce partner Deliveroo to showcase the potential ordering process for buying a Magnum ice cream in the metaverse and having it delivered to you in real life.
New Magnum Doubles Duo inspired by day and night 
Ice cream is no longer just a summer, daytime treat. The message of Magnum’s 2023 limited-edition Doubles is that for ice cream lovers, day or night, pleasure is always on. The Magnum Double Sunlover teams coconut ice cream with a tangy mango and passionfruit swirl, white cracking chocolate and crispy coconut pieces. Magnum Starchaser Double is made of double-swirled popcorn and caramel-flavoured ice cream coated in caramel sauce, cracking milk chocolate and caramelised corn pieces, an ideal accompaniment for a night under the stars.
It might surprise you to learn...
How’s this for an anniversary celebration? To mark 25 years of Magnum, the brand created a limited-edition, silver-coated milk chocolate Magnum filled with Marc de Champagne flavoured ice cream and a Marc de Champagne swirl.

text How has Unilever Nigeria grown in recent years?
Unilever Nigeria reported 35% growth in turnover in 2021, taking the business from ₦52 billion Nigerian naira in 2020 to ₦70.5 (€108 million to €145 million).
Gross profit was also up 84%, from ₦11.1 billion in 2020 to ₦20.4 billion in 2021 (€23 million to €42 million).
One-off income of ₦2.8 billion (€6.3 million) was generated when Unilever Nigeria completed the separation of its tea business last year. 
What is driving this strong growth? 
Throughout 2021, Unilever Nigeria focused on reinvesting in brands and aligning with Unilever’s global strategy of competitive, consistent, profitable, and responsible growth – in addition to investing in employees to develop a pool of future-fit talent and adopting rigorous plans to fuel growth through cost savings.
This model will continue to guide our Nigerian business.
Brand campaigns rooted in local insights are also connecting with consumers to boost the business. Knorr’s purpose ‘Eat for Good’ encourages consumers to change the world by changing what is on their plate. In Nigeria, we first communicate this message by teaching food diversity, using the most popular local dish, Jollof rice. Campaigns show consumers healthier ways to prepare this meal by incorporating diverse vegetables and cooking with Knorr to make the dishes extra-tasty. Take a look at the film below for inspiration.
Recipe sharing and in-person experiential activities from the brand also aim to inspire consumers to choose Knorr and change the way they cook. Earlier this year, Knorr brought together chefs, food critics and more than 5,000 consumers to mark World Jollof Day – an event celebrating the popular African rice dish beloved by countries from Nigeria to Ghana, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
Knorr’s chefs demonstrated how healthy, locally grown vegetables could be incorporated into the dish at home – along with Knorr products. Watch the video below to see a glimpse of the event.
Since the launch of Eat for Good, Knorr has seen growth in underlying sales, underlying value and brand power scores.
Knorr aims to reach 50 million Nigerians with the campaign by 2025.
How long has Unilever operated in Nigeria? 
Lever Brothers (West Africa) Ltd began trading soap in Nigeria in 1923. The company later started to sell food and laundry products, introducing Omo in 1960 and opening a production facility to manufacture the popular laundry brand locally in 1964.
In 1982 Lever Brothers opened a factory in Agbara, which still operates today, and the business changed its name to Unilever Nigeria plc in 2001. We’re the longest-serving manufacturing company in the country, marking 100 years in Nigeria in 2023.
What are some of Unilever Nigeria’s most popular brands?
Sunlight detergent is extremely popular, as is Closeup toothpaste and Knorr’s range of seasoning and stock cubes. In fact, Knorr’s new variant, enriched with natural ingredients and flavours, was one of Unilever Nigeria’s biggest success stories of 2021, contributing to business growth.
How are brands bringing their purpose to life in Nigeria?
Sunlight recently relaunched its purpose in Nigeria, setting out to help women reclaim their time and fulfil their potential for themselves, their families and their communities.
The brand is partnering with NGOs to support women to access training in skills that will help them to start a new career or scale up their existing small business. Watch the ad below to learn more.
Unilever’s Shakti programme is supporting women entrepreneurs across Nigeria too. Shakti offers women training in book-keeping, retailing and other business skills so they can become local vendors of Unilever products, earning a reliable and fair income by selling products within their community.
And Knorr’s Eat for Good campaign is also making an impact. Knorr believes that wholesome, nutritious food should be accessible and affordable for all and it’s encouraging Nigerian consumers to understand that they can change the world – and their health – for the better by changing what’s on their plate. The brand is promoting plant-based meals with Knorr seasoning as a key ingredient.
What else is Unilever doing to lead in sustainability in Nigeria?
This year Unilever Nigeria announced the launch of a new partnership to make sorbitol – a key ingredient in Closeup and Pepsodent toothpaste – from sustainably sourced cassava starch rather than from corn. The move means we will use locally grown cassava rather than imported corn to produce Closeup’s and Pepsodent formula, creating thousands of employment opportunities for factory workers, agronomists, back-office support staff and farmers.
Mrs Oluyemiusi Iranloye is CEO and Founder of the Psaltry International factory, where the new approach will produce 24 tonnes of cassava-derived sorbitol a day.
She said: “This factory, the first of its kind in Africa, is projected to created 25,000 direct and indirect jobs while empowering 100,000 rural farmers and families.”
The change to cassava starch marks a significant step forward in Unilever Nigeria’s localisation agenda, where the company is taking action to source raw materials locally and transparently. Working with the woman-owned Psaltry International factory also acts on Unilever Nigeria’s goal to create a more diverse, more inclusive and more secure supply chain.
Cassava piled high outside the Psaltry International sorbitol factory in Ado Awaiye, Nigeria 
What makes Nigeria unique as a market for Unilever?
In Nigeria, most people don’t shop for our products in supermarkets. Instead, products are more commonly sold in smaller, local stores run by individuals rather than retail companies. Online shopping and digital commerce accounts for a small but growing fraction of sales.
Nigeria also has a young, vibrant population. More than 200 million people live in the country, and the median age is 18.

text How it started
It’s three decades since Axe launched in a male grooming market that looked very different from the one we know today.
Young men in the 70s and early 80s had two choices: cologne or deodorant. Both posed a problem. Aftershaves tended to be overpowering and not particularly long-lasting. Deodorants were considered bland.
Axe saw that gap in the market and responded, creating a revolutionary new spray that combined an effective deodorant with a high-quality fragrance.
On 6 June 1983, Axe debuted in three classically masculine variants – Musk, Amber and Spice. The first country it reached was France – the nation where the world’s finest perfumers train and the European capital of scent design and trade. Positioned as ‘the first eau de toilette for men’, it was a fitting beginning to what would become one of the best-known brands in history.
Axe soon reached other European markets including the UK, where it’s famously known as Lynx. Body sprays were the first products to land, followed by antiperspirants and deodorant sticks. Shower gels followed in 1987.
In 2002, Axe hit the US, shaking up the male grooming category to offer products with personality and attraction at their core, as well as functional deodorant benefits.
How it’s going
Axe is now the world’s No.1 men’s fragrance brand, * worn by men in more than 90 countries across the globe. It’s an expert in male grooming and has been helping young guys feel confident and attractive for as long as any of them can remember.
Axe’s biggest market is the US, where its bestselling product is Axe Apollo body spray. The UK, where Axe is known as Lynx, is the second biggest, with Lynx Africa the country’s most popular male fragrance. Germany, Mexico and France make up the rest of Axe’s top five markets.
In 2021, Axe relaunched its core range globally, upgrading its body sprays and reimagining its Axe Effect campaign to reinforce the perception that attraction is for everyone and between anyone. If you’re into it and they’re into it, Axe is into it too.
Now, in 2023, Axe is redefining the world of luxury scents with the release of its Fine Fragrance collection across the US and Europe.
The set of body sprays was developed in partnership with Ann Gottlieb, one of the world’s top perfumers and the expert behind signature scents for a host of luxury brands. The collection comes in five scents, Blue Lavender, Aqua Bergamot, Green Geranium, Golden Mango and Pure Coconut, and it’s already making waves. Grooming experts named Axe Fine Fragrances Collection Blue Lavender Body Spray in the Men’s Health’s list of 20 Best Colognes for Men in 2023.
The purpose that powers it
Axe has always had the back of its users and the brand’s purpose is simple: give young guys an attraction power-up.
Axe believes in inclusivity, mutuality and progress, all while adding a touch of humour to everything it does – and these values underpin every new product, every ad and every brand partnership.
Brand new ideas
Fragrance expertise
Quality fragrances and constant innovation are at the heart of Axe’s enduring appeal. Fragrance is the key ingredient in Axe.
Every scent and every variation is tested rigorously. Axe products are crafted by the world’s leading perfumers – Givaudan and Firmenich. The brand spends millions sourcing the highest quality ingredients from across the globe to get the combinations just right, creating premium scents without designer price points.
In the UK, Lynx Africa is known as the G.O.A.T. male fragrance in the market – the ‘greatest of all time’ – and has sold over 400 million units since hitting the shelves.
The new Fine Fragrance Collection redefines what it means to be premium, and in blind tests 7 out of 10 men said they’d replace the scent of their current cologne with their favourite of the tested Axe fragrances. This new range is fresher, lighter and more modern than anything the brand has created before and features an eclectic range of scent profiles.
Science and technology
With 80% of Gen Z guys worrying about body odour, Axe is at the forefront of driving product innovation to ensure they can smell fresh everywhere no matter the conditions – and the only real way to smell irresistibly good all day is by offering high-end scents that also eliminate odour. The job of a deodorant or body spray sounds simple, but in reality it’s a mammoth task. That’s why Axe’s formulation processes involve serious scientific research and pioneering new discoveries. But it’s not all lab work. Fragrances are designed to feel and smell great too – the formula for confidence.
Drawing on 40 years of body spray research experience, Axe scientists added odour-busting zinc technology to Axe body sprays. This targets the root causes of body odour and absorbs odour molecules to ensure fragrance can shine through while keeping the user smelling fresh.
And that’s not all. Axe body sprays are formulated with an aluminum-free formula that is easy on the skin, tough on odour and instantly refreshing.
A brand with a bold personality
Axe is known for its bold, irreverent and humorous nature. Its campaigns and advertisements are unapologetic, often taking risks and pushing boundaries. Axe uses cheekiness and wit to attract the attention of young guys and encourage men to not to take themselves too seriously.

text There are some trade shows that innovators just can’t miss. And the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is one of them. 
The annual January showcase has been called the most influential tech event in the world, and this year more than 100,000 attendees and 3,200 exhibitors turned up to prove it.
We asked three Unilever leaders who attended the event to tell us which tech trends and innovations caught their eye and will shape their business thinking in 2023.
Vasiliki Petrou, CEO, Unilever Prestige
CES is a true cornucopia of next-level innovation. While there is so much to see, absorb and be inspired by, I left with three points that will remain my guiding focus for the year ahead.
The increasingly vital role that ‘experiential’ will play in retail moments – this has gone from being a rarity to a no-miss for brands to stand out in cluttered markets.
Sensorial immersion has become a non-negotiable in brand experiences. It is key to activating and delighting all the senses through both virtual and human means to enhance experiences and make them unforgettable.
It’s worth noting how key it is to build and nurture communities of fans, influencers and creators – placing the upmost importance on your immediate and wider communities from micro to macro, internal to external.
Tech picksWearables for wellness.
The convergence of industries as they move into new white spaces will continue to grow this year. Wellness is crossing over into beauty, health and devices, which is opening a world of new and exciting opportunities.
For example, once wearables were simply devices to monitor your step count, but thanks to AI and sensors that can activity track, they are increasingly capable of using data to give actionable suggestions to improve people’s overall wellbeing.
I loved finding out about Movano Health’s Evie smart ring tracker which is optimised for women’s health. It measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels that can help users understand patterns in sleep and even menstruation. Another timely development was the Nowatch, which doesn’t use time to keep you on schedule but instead delivers gentle vibrations based on readings of heart rate, sweat, physical movement and sleep patterns to improve a wearer’s mood and stress levels.
Sukru Dincer, Global VP, Digital & Sustainable Choices
It was a great inspiration to attend CES 2023 with the Unilever team. For me, three key observations were:
Perhaps as a result of Covid, we are seeing an increasing focus on personalised health/nutrition solutions.
The progress in data/digital across all touchpoints is paving the way to even smarter home appliances which are more precise and allowing better control.
Delivering on sustainability is the next big thing. There is a strong focus on energy/water-saving solutions and carbon-footprint reduction, from in-home appliances to next-generation automobiles.
Tech picksSustainable in-home and portable energy solutions, plus toilet tech that provides health scans.
Schneider Electric unveiled its Schneider Home Energy Tracking Solution which allows home-owners to monitor energy consumption by individual appliance and decide where to prioritise power during an outage via an app. Out-of-home Californian firm Jackery showcased a selection of portable devices that make generating renewable energy easy and possible for individuals. Its Air-W is a portable mini wind turbine that can produce 200W of power, while LightCycle-S1 is a wheeled battery that can store up to 3,500Wh of electricity and offer 3,500W of power.
In the personalised healthcare space, a Wi-Fi-enabled toilet from Withings caused quite a stir at the show. It has two types of replaceable cartridges to track different functions such as menstrual cycles and ovulation or nutrition and hydration and uses a ‘stream ID’ to identify different people. When the test is done, data goes to a companion app where you can go through all its findings.
Dallia Herrtage, Global Partnerships & Innovation Lead & Nutrition Head of Media
I love this phase just after my return from CES 2023 when I get to go through all my notes and start considering what it all means and how you can action it. This year, the three stand-out themes for me were…
Health & Wellness. We saw a wealth of technology designed to improve health and wellbeing. Smart products including mirrors, toilets and pillows that use biometric data to monitor the body and provide suggestions. Much of this has been seen before, but at CES 2023 we saw the connection between personal bio-data and the environment the person was in, particularly the home. The AARP (an organisation aimed at meeting the needs of retirees) had a huge space at the conference. It was interesting to see the breadth of technologies designed to help the over-50s audience live well.
Sustainability. The theme of sustainability was seen everywhere and across many verticals. It seems that we are at an important moment in time where consumer awareness of climate change and the desire to make more sustainable decisions is meeting macroeconomic drivers. Rising costs across energy and goods mean that consumers are looking for ways to reduce waste and therefore cost, and we saw many exhibitors with smart home solutions to reduce food, water and energy waste uniting practical and ethical motivations.
Metaverse/Web3. This was a hot area with a lot of floor space devoted to gaming, Web 3.0 and the metaverse. We saw a lot of incredible VR/AR applications, impressive screens, connected experiences, and meaningful steps in its evolution and growth.
Tech picksImmersive gaming tech and sustainable food solutions to cut back on waste.
Dolby.io is a new developer platform by Dolby Labs that puts Dolby sight and sound technology into hands of developers. I was impressed by the quality and sensory elements of the virtual experiences that can be created.
It was also great to see Sony showcase Project Leonardo and improve accessibility in the gaming space through its adaptable controller for the PlayStation which allows users with limited motor control “to craft their own play experience”.
In the food tech space, I really loved Kaltech’s ‘Food Fresh Keeper’. This smart preservation box prevents bread and fruit from getting mouldy or rotten outside a refrigerator and could play huge role in eliminating food waste.
text At the UN Environment Assembly earlier this year, 175 countries agreed to begin negotiations on a UN treaty on plastic pollution. With projections that plastic pollution is set to rapidly increase by 2040, governments have agreed to work together to find common solutions to this critical issue.
While business has been laying the pathway with voluntary action – most notably the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Global Commitment – it’s clear that such initiatives must be supported by policy if the world is to move with the speed required to truly solve this problem.
That’s why we’re advocating for a robust legally binding treaty that sets common goals, rules and obligations that member states must implement. One that helps governments create a level playing field for the industry and prevents a patchwork of disconnected solutions.
Next week, the world gets down to business
The agreement made at UNEA provides an outline of what the treaty will be and how governments should come together to work out the finer details. It set in motion a series of twice-yearly Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meetings (INCs) which aim to have a final text ready by the end of 2024. This is a highly ambitious timeframe for a global instrument of this sort.
The first INC takes place in Uruguay next week and will see over 500 government representatives gather to begin negotiations.
The INCs offer a chance for stakeholders to attend and put across their views on what the treaty should be. These stakeholders include thought leaders from civil society, science and academia as well as business. Importantly, it also includes representatives from the informal sector (local waste collectors or waste pickers), whose role in the global recycling system often goes unrecognised.
Unilever will be present in Uruguay as part of the newly formed Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty – a group of over 90 leading businesses and financial institutions committed to supporting the development of an ambitious, effective and legally binding UN treaty.
We’re endorsing a business vision which sets out a collective view on what it should achieve and how. We believe it must set the right enabling conditions to successfully end plastic pollution and support sustainable business growth.
As Richard Slater, our Chief R&D Officer, says: “The UN treaty on plastic pollution offers a historic chance to create an effective, legally binding, global plan to tackle plastic waste at the scale and speed required.”
What is Unilever asking for?
What should the treaty achieve?
Reduce the production and use of virgin plastic, including a clear timeline for the elimination of problematic types like undetectable carbon black plastic (industry is already voluntarily eliminating problematic plastic through the EMF Global Commitment).
Improve the circulation of plastic, keeping it at its highest value in the economy to ensure recycled plastic becomes the norm in packaging in the long term.
Prevent plastic leakage through the development of robust collection and processing infrastructure, and well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility schemes.
How should the treaty achieve this?
Set global targets, rules and obligations for all actors, allowing flexibility for national circumstances. This will provide the confidence and certainty for business to invest in long-term solutions.
Harmonise regulatory standards and policies across markets. We operate in 190 countries, so the current disconnected patchwork of solutions hinders progress towards our goals. Industry has already set harmonised design standards for packaging.
Define common definitions and reporting metrics to ensure accountability on action. Industry has already agreed definitions and reporting mechanisms through the EMF Global Commitment.

text Karachi, October 27, 2021 - Ismail Foundation and Unilever Pakistan are partnering to provide sustainable clean drinking water to underserved communities in Pakistan. As a first, the two companies are joining hands to establish an RO plant at Rahim Yar Khan under Ismail Foundation’s Water and Sanitation Logistics (WASL) initiative, which is their flagship water project. Unilever Pakistan’s commitment to the cause forms under their efforts to combat climate change and support clean water stewardship programs.
Mr. Amir Paracha, Chairman Unilever Pakistan and Mr. Hamid Ismail, CEO Bisconni & Snackcity recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to formalise this partnership at the Unilever Pakistan Head Office in Karachi. Unilever Pakistan will be working with Ismail Foundation as part of this effort to create the supply of low-cost clean drinking water through a sustainable operational model managed by Ismail Foundation.
The plant will help provide 2,500 families clean drinking water daily making it a unique and one of its kind projects. This will address the issue of water borne diseases and create healthier and more vibrant community making a lasting social impact. The provision of clean drinking water improves health, education, quality of life, creates employment as a result empowering community.
Mr. Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan, expressed the organisation’s commitment to sustainable environment friendly solution, “Unilever is committed to a clean future for the planet and Pakistan through urgent and collective climate action. Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries when it comes to water scarcity and has already begun to observe some devastating first signs of the crisis. It will take all of us to come together through effective partnerships to ensure our continued sustainable development in the face of rising climate change and we are pleased to collaborate with Ismail Foundation for this project as part of this ambition. Our first project is due to begin in Rahim Yar Khan city, which has a vital place in Unilever Pakistan’s history, present and future, and we aim to take this partnership forward for the benefit of our communities in Pakistan.”
WASL is a project by Ismail Foundation which was launched in 2020 with an aim to provide a sustainable means to high-quality and affordable clean drinking water in underserved communities of Karachi. The first two RO plants under this project were established in Bagh-e-Korangi and Landhi which have proven to be a reliable source of clean drinking water in the area. By collaborating with Unilever, Ismail Foundation aims to grow across Pakistan and scale WASL into a major social enterprise addressing the need of clean drinking water in the country. Speaking at the occasion, Mr. Hamid Ismail, CEO Bisconni and Snackcity said “I aspire to grow WASL into a large social enterprise which is self-sustainable and grows organically through the funds generated from within itself and with partnerships with organizations like Unilever which support social causes with great passion and enthusiasm. WASL will provide clean drinking water to over two million people within one year across Pakistan in turn creating a social revolution by impacting health, education, and women empowerment in communities.”
text More than 50% market share in India is good news for any business. But dishwashing brand Vim from Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has a track record that also boasts a business delivering strong double-digit growth, with a range of products that 90% of Indians have used at least once in the last five years.
“Vim’s product range offers practical high-performance solutions to a wide range of consumer pain points that cut across geographic and socio-economic differences,” says Deepak Subramanian, Home Care General Manager, South Asia.
“It is this diversity and efficacy that is fuelling its ability to connect with consumers.”
Products that get the job done
So how did they do it? Central government schemes aimed at introducing liquified petroleum gas-fuelled cookers have certainly played a part. By reducing the number of wood-fuelled stoves used in rural areas, these initiatives also reduced the availability of ash, which was traditionally used to clean cooking utensils, and a new rural market for dishwashing products has opened up.
But this is not Vim’s only driving force. The brand’s remarkable growth is also grounded in its superior product range, its consumer-focused innovations and an impactful purpose that is resonating with different people.
“Our consumers’ love for the brand is reflected in the fact that Vim has the highest equity of any HUL brand in the country,” says Deepak. “In short, Vim is synonymous with superior dishwashing.”
Here’s how innovation and purpose have fuelled Vim’s growth
Superior portfolio
Vim’s product portfolio showcases a range of products that cut across all socio-economic groups. At the heart of the brand family is undoubtedly the Vim dishwashing bar, the product which brought the brand to life for the first time.
While still a favourite in India, where both the bar and its ‘power of 100 lemons’ tagline have stood the test of time, these days the power of mint and neem (also known as Indian lilac) also feature on Vim’s newer product labels, bearing testament to the brand’s determination to tune in to the preferences of both their existing and potential consumers.
Consumer-led innovation 
Whether it is banishing cooking odours with super-charged fragrance, protecting delicate cooking utensils with dilutable dishwasher gels or (more recently) supporting the Covid-driven trend for dishwashers with Vim Matic dishwasher powder, Vim – an expert in ‘all things dishwash’ – is ensuring that consumers have no need to shop outside the brand.
In 2020 this led to a significant brand extension with the launch of the patented Vim Power Scrub, the brand’s first dishwashing accessory. With an innovative triangular head to allow easier cleaning of hard-to-reach spots, and three times thicker fibre which lasts longer than ordinary scrubbers, the innovation has been well received in India.
The power of purpose
“In India, the burden of household chores has historically fallen on the shoulders of women. However, Vim has taken on a purpose to change society’s perspective to see women’s role beyond that of a homemaker,” says Abhinav Ravikumar, Home and Hygiene Innovations Head, South Asia, explaining why the brand’s marketing has pivoted to more purpose-led advertising.
Vim’s latest advertising campaign, for example, shows a young bride-to-be challenging traditional social expectations that women should be solely responsible for household chores and encouraging her future husband to see it as his responsibility too. Winner of the Un-Stereotype category in the Kantar Creative Effectiveness Awards in India, the campaign has clearly hit the right note with consumers.
“Early results showed that viewers appreciated Vim’s positive approach to the issue, without playing the blame game,” says Abhinav. “This has been effective in improving awareness, brand love and future consideration, while also driving the key message about how effectively and easily Vim cleans dishes.”
What’s next
Together these initiatives have led Vim to experience continuous growth while making cleaning easier.
“With a purpose-led marketing campaign, strong consumer trust and a structured strategy to expand both in terms of markets and products, we hope to ensure that consumers continue to put Vim in their shopping baskets and allow this upward trajectory to continue,” says Abhinav.
text Investing in our planet is not just the theme for Earth Day 2023, it’s becoming an increasingly louder ask from people to the companies they buy from.
According to a recent survey by The Economist, consumers believe that brands have as much responsibility as governments to create positive environmental change.
What’s more, they’re increasingly prepared to take action with their wallets, with 66% of consumers who took part in a survey from McKinsey & Company saying they actively align themselves with brands that are compatible with their values and priorities.
In 2020, Unilever established a Climate & Nature Fund with a mandate to invest €1 billion by 2030 in projects to accelerate decarbonisation and nature solutions globally.
This Earth Day, Swetha Stotra Bhashyam, a wildlife biologist and activist caught up with Eric Soubeiran, VP of Business Operations Sustainability and MD of our Climate & Nature Fund, to ask him about the actions being taken, the progress being made, and the work left to do.
S: Thanks Eric, for having this interview with me. One of the first things I want to really understand is what does the Fund do?
E: Well, it’s more than a fund, it’s an investment impact-led platform, aiming to transform the way our products are made so they’re more sustainable, and to connect that sustainability journey with brand benefits.
One of the things we want to do is invest more in regenerative agriculture. For example, we’ve been helping farmers in Iowa to produce soy in ways that protect soil health. And soy is a key ingredient in our Hellmann’s mayonnaise, so when you buy Hellmann’s, the choice you’ve made is helping to support nature.
And that’s important for us.
We have the chance to interact with close to 3.4 billion people in the world who use a Unilever product every day. And that interaction is a great opportunity to help make sustainable living commonplace. It’s also a great responsibility.
S: What is your vision for the Fund?
E: To use Unilever’s convening power to make sure 1 + 1 adds up to more than 2.
We are a big organisation and that helps us attract and connect new partners and scale solutions. In Iowa, for example, we partnered with farmers, Pepsi and a non-profit called Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI) to make the project happen and help renew the land for future generations.
We are also a founding member of an initiative called the Rimba Collective which is working to protect and restore at least 500,000 hectares of forest, with and for forest communities.
We want the €1 billion we’ve set aside to be used in projects like this that drive change and attract partners to help us to co-finance and scale solutions. That way, we can achieve at least double the contribution we’ve made.
When you don’t have an intimate connection between the actions you’re taking, your real business and the ability to scale those solutions, that’s when accusations of greenwashing arise. 
Eric Soubeiran, MD Unilever Climate & Nature Fund and VP of Business Operations Sustainability
S: That’s a powerful place to be and a powerful place to influence change. Do you think an initiative like this is something other companies should have?
E: Yes, but first companies need to experience what I call “the transparency shock”.
This means looking at your value chain, being very transparent and deciding where you can have an impact because you are relevant in that space, and where you want to have an impact.
Take the work we’re doing in ice cream. We know people love dairy ice cream and the indulgence it brings. But we also know the consequences of methane emissions.
Ideally you want to develop low carbon dairy production programmes that also keep the indulgence of our ice cream. By connecting both needs, you’re creating benefit for consumers who love ice cream, and benefit for our business while reducing our impact on the world.
When you work at that intersection, you find places where investing your money, resources, energy and passion can have the biggest impact, otherwise you won’t use the engine of your organisation to scale up solutions.
S: When you hear about funds like these, the first thing a lot of people think is it’s just big companies using it to greenwash. How would you respond to that?
E: I think the answer is found in what you are trying to do. Is it transformational or peripheral to your business?
When you don’t have an intimate connection between the actions you’re taking, your real business and the ability to scale those solutions, that’s when accusations of greenwashing arise.
For us, the Climate & Nature Fund is not a communication tool; it’s a doing tool. And the changes it’s helping us make are core to our business.
When we talk about how we grow soy for mayonnaise, it’s at the core. When we talk about dairy use for ice cream, it’s core. When we talk about the restoration of a sensitive ecosystem while still using palm oil, it’s core.
We’re trying to be where the big unlocks are. And we’re getting things done before we communicate.
S: Unilever has committed to achieving net zero across its value chain by 2039. How are you scaling up this work to help you reach that goal?
E: You know Swetha, there is a difference between me telling you I want to be fit and me telling you I’m going to wake up every day at 6am and run 10 kilometres.
What’s important is the specifics, and in sustainability strategies that’s very often what is missing.
We’re not in a decade of committing any more. We’re in a decade of delivering. But delivery is only enabled if you have a good strategy.
For example, we know the importance of tackling emissions from dairy-related ingredients in our Ice Cream business. But we also know there will be differences in the way we tackle this issue depending on geographies.
The dairy intensity of milk in the US is different from that in India, so the types of levers you utilise to reduce your carbon intensity is going to be different in each place.
In the US, it’s about optimising the system, making sure you capture all the methane emissions, and using the manure-generated fertiliser to close your end loop.
In India, it’s a grazing and pasture-based system. You need to work on the diet of the cows, increase animal welfare and provide access to clean water. Because if you do that, then the cows produce more litres of milk and you reduce the carbon intensity per litre.
The role of my team and the Fund is to find the roadblocks and decide what type of action we need. To look at the KPIs we want to achieve, put in timings, resources and how much it’s going to cost. Having that plan will help us to reach the 2039 goal.
S: Do the Fund’s initiatives have social and ecological justice built into them?
E: For me environmental justice and social justice go hand-in-hand.
If you want to change the agricultural system, you need to do it with and for the farmer; otherwise it doesn’t work and it doesn’t last.
If you want to work on afforestation efforts and protect forests, you need to make sure the indigenous people have a living wage and an income that makes it better for them to stay where they are instead of moving to the cities and selling their land that will then be deforested.
Same thing with cocoa. We identify the biggest risks and make sure that when we develop an agricultural programme, a social programme goes hand in hand and ensures a living wage and tackles issues like child labour.
In almost all the sustainability programmes we’re developing, the social aspect is essential, it’s the enabler.
S: As a biologist, I’m also interested in what’s happening on the nature side of the Climate & Nature Fund. Can you tell me more?
It’s based on three pillars:
Taking an integrated landscape approach to protect and restore nature on the 30% of land that the world cannot afford to lose. That means working with stakeholders in communities to decide together what to plant and grow to help protect and regenerate 1.5Mha of land, forests and oceans by 2030. We’re also progressing towards a deforestation-free supply chain, and for this transparency is so important, having the tools in place to monitor our impact. We’re using satellite technologies for that.
Using our portfolio as a food player to develop new types of diets and food to help increase biodiversity. This can mean more experiences, more smells, more taste, and more texture. It’s why Knorr is using different plant-based ingredients in its products and recipes.
Ensuring that regenerative agriculture and production that makes improving soil health an established part of growing our ingredients. Because healthy soil doesn’t just deliver great crops, it sequesters carbon and brings back worms and birds.
S: How do you see the Climate & Nature Fund working to transform the businesses as a whole?
E: Right now, the world is very complex. It’s very difficult to control anything. But you’re left with one very important tool which is creating energy at the right inflection point to influence the system.
And this is what the Climate & Nature Fund is all about. Investing significantly in a few chosen tipping points that can influence industry.
We’ve selected our battles and defined seven priorities:
And we are going to invest in these systematically and significantly. Once you do that, you create energy in the system.
It’s also where we can use what Unilever is buying and the €35 billion of natural commodities we buy annually to leverage our convening power and influence transformational change across industry.
S: If you were to come back in 2039, what would you hope would have been achieved by the Climate & Nature Fund?
E: What would be really good is to have a handful of large-scale programmes that have proven that sustainability and value creation can work hand in hand. If we do that, there would be no questions any more about sustainability and our brands. It will be fully embedded into our way of doing business and then we will leverage the full power of Unilever.
E: Swetha, can I ask you that question from a consumer and activist perspective?
S: To be the dreamer, I would love to see Unilever starting the revolution in the business sector – so I could enjoy products like ice cream guilt-free, knowing that it was made taking account of its impact on the planet. 
I would like people in 2039 to look at Unilever as the one who started this movement, seeing real changes in the way products are made and other companies following Unilever's lead on this.
On the activist side, I would love to see your employees actively talking about it and engaging with the public on how they are proud to be part of Unilever because they made change happen. Yeah, that would be beautiful to see.

text On 27 April, we announced our results for the first quarter of 2023, which reflected a good start to the year with another quarter of strong topline growth. Underlying sales growth (USG) accelerated to 10.5%, with turnover up 7.0% on the same period last year.
Our growth was broad-based across our five business groups and underpinned by strong performances from our billion+ euro brands – in particular OMO, Hellmann’s, Rexona and Lux – which delivered 12.1% USG and now account for 54% of Group turnover.
“We are continuing to execute well on our strategic priorities,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “We have stepped up both the effectiveness of our innovation and the investment behind our brands. We continue to shift our portfolio into higher growth spaces, with the delivery of another quarter of double-digit sales growth in Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing.
“We remain focused on navigating through continued macroeconomic uncertainty and are confident in our ability to deliver another year of strong growth, which remains our first priority.”
Here’s a look at the performance highlights from each business group, and how innovation from our brands is driving this positive momentum.
Beauty & Wellbeing
Within our Beauty & Wellbeing business group, the Hair Care category delivered high single-digit growth and also returned to positive volume growth, helped by the continued roll-out of our Sunsilk relaunch. TRESemmé grew strongly and the new Clear Anti Hair Fall in China continued to perform well.
In our Skin Care category, Vaseline and Pond’s delivered double-digit growth, supported by innovations with additional consumer benefits, such as the premium Gluta-Hya serum which revitalises skin overnight and boosts skin elasticity. Read more about some of Vaseline’s innovations.
Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with strong contributions from Paula’s Choice, Hourglass and Liquid I.V. Read more about our Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing businesses.
Personal Care
In our Personal Care business group, the Deodorants category grew high double-digit. Rexona accelerated its strong performance, helped by premium and superior 72-hour protection technology. We launched our Axe Fine Fragrance range, which combines odour protection with fine fragrances and freshness, contributing to double-digit growth for the brand. Read more about Rexona here.
Skin Cleansing grew high single-digit, driven by Latin America and South Asia. In the US, we launched our first Dove 24-hour Renewing Micromoisture body wash which actively regenerates the skin’s moisture. Lux grew double-digit, still benefiting from the relaunch of its bars which provide a further improved skin care experience, delivering glow and flawless complexion.
Growth in Oral Care was helped by Close Up which grew double-digit with good performance in South Asia and Africa.
Home Care
In Home Care, our Fabric Cleaning category grew double-digit, with capsules and liquids performing well as we continued to drive premiumisation. We launched plastic-free packaging for our capsules in France and the UK under OMO. Our Fabric Enhancers category grew high single-digit, driven by price. Comfort grew strongly in Latin America and Turkey. Read about our Dirt Is Good laundry brands.
In our Home & Hygiene category, Domestos grew double-digit and we launched new Power Foams which expand once applied to eliminate germs, even in the hardest-to-reach places.
Nutrition
In our Nutrition business group, the growth of our Dressings category was led by Hellmann’s, with communication centred on our ‘Make taste not waste’ campaign. Read more about how Hellmann’s is growing.
The biggest category in this business group, Scratch Cooking Aids, grew high single-digit. Africa, where we relaunched fortified Knorr stock cubes to address iodine and zinc deficiencies, grew double-digit with positive price and volume while North Asia declined.
Our business-to-business arm, Unilever Food Solutions, grew double-digit as China recovered throughout the quarter and other markets continued to deliver strong growth.
Ice Cream
In-home Ice Cream grew low single-digit but volumes declined as consumption remained impacted across regions by the discretionary nature of the category in a heavily inflationary environment. Out-of-home Ice Cream grew double-digit with positive price and volume in anticipation of a good ice cream season.
Magnum grew strongly, supported by our new Starchaser and Sunlover limited-edition innovation, while the Heart brand grew mid single-digit. Cornetto grew double-digit, helped by the launch of limited-edition variants. Read more about our Magnum and Wall’s brands.
text Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps we will take to reduce operational emissions by 100% by 2030 and achieve net zero across our value chain by 2039. 
In a series of interviews, Unilever is introducing some of the many people helping to deliver its action plan and making change happen. Hannah Hislop and Subhi Barakat, Unilever’s Climate Action Global Sustainability Managers, are part of the team ensuring our business is using its voice to advocate for real change now.
What does your job involve?
Subhi Barakat: Our role involves supporting the business to deliver our own climate goals, while leveraging Unilever’s influence to drive the system-level change that’s needed to enable not just Unilever and other businesses but also entire economies to transition to net zero emissions.
Hannah Hislop: We’re part of the global team looking after Unilever’s overarching sustainability strategy, stakeholder partnerships and advocacy. The team is helping the business to navigate sustainability challenges and engage in the external world, driving the systemic change we need to tackle all sorts of issues, from climate change to deforestation to social inequality.
What first drew you both to the role?
HH: I joined Unilever ten years ago from an environmental policy think tank. I started out working on packaging and recycling, and it was clear companies needed supportive government policies to be able to deliver our packaging targets, for example the introduction of recycling facilities in countries that don’t have formal waste systems. Then I spent several years working on eliminating deforestation, which is such an important part of the climate picture, so it was quite a natural step to start working on climate more broadly.
SB: I originally trained as an electrical engineer, working on semiconductor physics, but then went to law school and became a public international lawyer and multilateral treaty negotiator. Most of my work with the UN and NGOs saw me supporting very poor countries with their national green growth strategies and in the UN climate negotiations. After working on international frameworks for a long time, I decided to see what I could do in the private sector to help drive action to deliver the global goals I helped put in place.
When I started looking at which private sector actors I’d want to work for, I needed to find an organisation that had integrity, a good reputation, and showed leadership. There were only a few companies on the list and Unilever was one of them. It was already trying to deliver change at an international level and had the muscle and clout to make a difference.
How is Unilever accelerating climate action?
HH: We use the ‘onion model’ of change in our team. At the bulb of the onion, you have what you can do with your own operations. That’s very important because it demonstrates credibility and it’s vital that we walk the talk. Unilever has reduced operational emissions by 64% since 2015, which puts us on track in this area. But it’s also only a small proportion of our emissions, about 2%, so we know we need to do a lot more.
The next layer out is our value chain, which is where most of our emissions lie – over 60% come from raw materials and packaging. This is where we are focused on engaging our suppliers and supporting those with highest impact to take the steps they need to get climate-fit.
Then come our brands and how they can commercialise sustainability in terms of their innovation and consumer marketing. For example, our use of refills and changes in product formulations and our strategy on plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy.
The last layer is our wider influence on society and it’s huge. It includes high-level advocacy in support of the Paris Agreement goals and work on quite specific issues on nature and the voluntary carbon market. We’re also part of trade associations and business coalitions helping to speed up climate action.
Why is it so important that forward-thinking companies are using their voice and their influence?
SB: The reality is that in most economies, anywhere from 40–70% of the economy is the private sector. A lot of investment capital is in the hands of those actors, and they can really help shape what our economies and societies will look like going forward, so any kind of systemic change to address a big crisis like climate change or nature loss will absolutely require business to be on board.
Historically, we can see that governments heavy-handedly laying down rules that businesses aren’t part of shaping doesn’t usually work. Vice versa, leaving it for business to voluntarily do what they feel is needed without governments taking on their roles and responsibilities and helping to put in guardrails also doesn’t work. Governments and businesses need to work together towards shared objectives, with each playing their complementary part.
That’s where we come in, in terms of how we engage not only with governments, policymakers and regulators but also with other businesses and platforms. Unilever can help highlight the need to make policy shifts and draw on our experience to show how it’s good for business and the economy. By taking a leadership role, we can embolden governments to be more ambitious, which in turn gives businesses the confidence to take action.
Why did Unilever decide it was important to be a Principal Partner of COP26?
HH: Politicians or national leaders need businesses to say, ‘we want you to make changes because we have ambitious targets and we can’t meet those targets until policy changes’. If businesses apply pressure, then governments can put those laws in place, which levels the playing field between companies and incentivises them to go further.
But to get that ‘ambition loop’ spinning, you need businesses to be outspoken about climate and the changes they want to see, and also the barriers to decarbonisation they’re facing so that governments can unlock those barriers. That’s why we were one of 11 Principal Partners of the COP climate summit last year. We wanted to use our voice and influence for good.
Business was a key player at the last COP in a way that five years previously, you just wouldn’t have seen. Companies were completely central to so many of the plurilateral announcements on things like forests, coal and transport. It now feels like there’s a much more integrated conversation going on and that’s a lot healthier for the process as a whole.
How have things moved on in the last year?
SB: One thing that has changed is that, whether it’s from governments, companies or NGOs, there’s now broader agreement that collectively we’re not on track despite our best efforts. What’s needed is more action and more collaboration to tackle the hard stuff.
For Unilever, we’re mindful that we’ll need to keep stretching and pushing towards more ambition even as we’re delivering. The hardest tasks are where all the big opportunities are, because whoever can crack those challenges can take advantage of the transition and really help bring along the rest of society with them.
What are our asks of governments in terms of tackling climate change now?
HH: We need to see more ambition and urgency. We know that we must limit warming to 1.5°C, and what that means in practice is that governments have to essentially reorientate their economies in a way that will lead to net zero emissions by 2050. To get to that point, this is the decisive decade. The world needs to halve emissions by 2030 to be on track.
We also want a faster clean energy transformation. We need governments to be setting the right frameworks and incentivising businesses to do the right thing, whether it comes to investing or innovating to ensure the transition to clean energy. Then it’s a win–win for everybody.
There needs to be overall systems transformation, incorporating everything from land use change to adaptation and the need for a just transition. It’s about takeing people with us as we go on this journey and determine what kind of economy and society we want to transition to.
What is the value of working in coalitions?
HH: A lot of businesses are facing similar challenges so there is value in sharing best practice. It’s particularly important for companies to work together on the emissions in their shared value chain and the emissions downstream from their products.
SB: This is just too big a problem for anyone to move the needle on alone. We need to bring together a plurality of voices across industries, sectors and geographies, to all send a collective message about the direction we want to go. And we can only add greater legitimacy by working with governments and other stakeholders.
HH: Businesses like Unilever are coming together with their peers and saying with a clear, loud voice that climate action is fertile territory for growth, and the only way to tackle the interlinked crises affecting all businesses. The more that we can coordinate and come together with one really strong voice, the more that message will get heard.
How can Unilever help to enable climate justice as we transition to a net zero world?
SB: When it comes to climate justice, we’re predominantly talking about less advantaged people or communities. Expanding Unilever’s model of multi-stakeholder engagement, making sure those people’s voices are at the table, that their priorities are being take seriously and that they can have a say in a lot of the decision-making, is key.
As well as protecting our own businesses from risks associated with worsening climate change impacts, we also need to see an increase in efforts across the private sector that goes beyond the boundaries of company operations and value chains. Ultimately, this is about a transformation of the societies that businesses operate in, not just the transformation of businesses themselves.
What are you hopeful about?
HH: It’s important just how many people seem to be waking up to the climate challenge. To me, it’s really encouraging that so many ordinary people are realising this is an issue that’s going to affect not their grandchildren, not even their children, but their lives today and over the next decades. What does that mean for businesses like ours? Well, already we’re feeling growing consumer demand for quality and affordable products that don’t cost the earth – and we can only expect that to grow in the future.
text How it started
Hellmann’s mayonnaise and its trademark blue ribbon started out in a small shop in New York. In 1913 Richard Hellmann and his wife Margaret used their home-made mayonnaise recipe in salads and sandwiches that they sold from their Manhattan deli on Columbus Avenue. Their mayo proved to be so popular with customers that they quickly began to sell it in glass jars – with a blue ribbon to indicate the highest quality.
Word spread so fast that soon the Hellmann’s decided to close the deli and focus on the mayonnaise. By the end of the 1920s, Hellmann’s had expanded nationwide in the US. By 1961, the brand had gone international, launching first in the UK, followed by Latin America, Europe, Canada and South Africa.
In tandem with its international expansion, the brand also gradually expanded its portfolio to include ketchup, salad dressings and a range of flavoured mayonnaises.
How it’s going
Available in 65 countries, including 18 new markets in the last five years, it is estimated that one thousand Hellmann’s products are sold globally every minute. This makes it not only the world’s No.1 mayonnaise but also one of Unilever’s fastest-growing brands.
Now, after having achieved impressive double-digit year-on-year growth since 2020 (10% in 2020, 11% in 2021 and 20% in the first half of 2022), Hellmann’s hit a new milestone this month when it officially became a €2 billion brand.
Many factors have fed into Hellmann’s rising growth figures, but a holistically superior product has always been at the heart of its success. Research shows that Hellmann’s products are repeatedly preferred by consumers for their unmistakable taste and creaminess. And for the fact that they are made with real, simple and sustainable ingredients and sold in recyclable packaging. It is the only leading dressings brand in North America and Europe, for example, that uses 100% free-range or cage-free eggs, 100% sustainable oils and 100% recycled plastic packaging.
Product innovation has also played a critical role, particularly as regards the growing market demand for plant-based alternatives which Bloomberg Intelligence predicts could swell to $162 billion in the next decade (from $29.4 billion in 2020).
Since its launch in 2016, Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise has become the leading vegan mayonnaise in many markets, with sales doubling year after year.
The purpose that powers It
Combined with a great product and consumer-relevant innovation, Hellmann’s growth has also been powered by the brand’s purpose which is to help people enjoy great-tasting food without worry or waste. As part of Unilever’s larger commitment to helping achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 (reducing food waste by 50% by 2030), Hellmann’s aims to inspire and enable 100 million people around the world every year to be more resourceful with their food so that they waste less.
No one ever sets out wanting to throw food away. People have good intentions, but then life gets in the way and food waste happens as an unintended outcome. People want to be part of the solution but often don’t know how.
Christina Bauer-Plank, VP, Hellmann’s 
Having helped people turn even the simplest ingredients into delicious meals for over a century, the brand certainly has the credibility to speak with some authority about making the most of leftovers. However, the brand wanted to go further and really understand what was driving food waste.
In order to build this deep consumer understanding, the brand launched some of the largest and longest intervention studies in the area of household food waste in collaboration with leading experts and behavioural economists from consultancyBEWorks. The results were then used as the foundations of the Make Taste Not Waste campaign and the Fridge Night behaviour change programme (see Purpose below).
One of the learnings from these studies was that most people are not aware that they are wasting food. “No one ever sets out wanting to throw food away,” says Christina Bauer-Plank, VP, Hellmann’s. “People have good intentions, but then life gets in the way and food waste happens as an unintended outcome. People want to be part of the solution but often don’t know how.”
Clearly, there was an information gap and for the last two years Hellmann’s has been looking to fill it by providing inspirational and practical ideas of how to use up food through its global Make Taste, Not Waste campaign, digital and social content and its Fridge Night behaviour change programme available in the form of an app and e-booklet (see the iconic ads below).
So far, reach and impact have been impressive, with the campaign inspiring more than 200 million people across the US, Canada and the UK in 2021 alone to make taste, not waste. In addition, it has been proved that the behaviour change programme has helped families reduce their food waste by 33%.
“The success that we have achieved with our programmes, combined with our double-digit growth, provides a compelling argument that doing good supports business growth,” concludes Christina.
Brand Ideas
Product: Vegan Mayo
Two major factors guided Hellmann’s development of their first vegan mayo. The first was the understanding that most people knew that a plant-based diet was better for their health and for the health of the planet. The second was the knowledge that taste would be the deciding factor in consumers making the switch. That was why they were committed to creating a vegan mayo that would surprise consumers by having the same great taste as the original. UK market consumer reviews indicate that they have succeeded… perhaps even enough to challenge the blue ribbon original. “People are rating Hellmann’s Vegan to be perhaps the best mayo we have ever made,” says Christina.
Purpose: Fridge Night
Using up food we already have can make a massive difference to the amount that goes to waste in our kitchens. That’s why Hellmann’s launched the Fridge Night Mission: an evidence-based, four-week programme where participants use up the food they already have one night a week. It has proved to reduce household food waste by up to 33%. Among other resources available to support the mission are Hellmann’s Flexipes: a series of recipes that provide a simple 3+1 formula that home cooks can adapt according to what they have in the fridge. These and other tools and resources will now be available through Hellmann’s Fridge Night app and e-booklet, which launched in Canada in 2021 and is now available for download in the US on iOS.
Packaging: Hellmann’s transitioning to 100% recycled bottles
Hellmann’s has been transitioning to jars and bottles made from 100% recycled plastic as part of its commitment to exiting the use of virgin plastic. The switch started in Mexico in 2019, followed by US and Canada in 2020 and the UK in 2021.
The new recycled packaging is made of the highest quality food-grade plastic, ensuring the mayonnaise inside has the same great taste that consumers know and love, and the new bottles will feature a ‘New 100% Recycled Bottle’ logo on the front of pack so shoppers can feel confident in making sustainable choices.
Campaign: Animal Crossing 
No food should go to waste… not even virtual food. That’s why, when Hellmann’s noticed that players of the popular Nintendo’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons game were complaining about spoiled turnips, they created Hellmann’s Island where players could drop off their spoiled turnips. For each turnip dropped off, Hellmann’s made a financial donation to distribute the equivalent of two nutritious meals to vulnerable people through FareShare, the UK’s largest charity fighting hunger and food waste. The programme reached an overall target of 50,000 meals.
It might surprise you to learn…
Hellmann’s mayonnaise has been used as a unexpected ingredient in many recipes, including chocolate cake, brownies and even gnocchi! Some cooks swap it in for oil, butter or eggs in cakes, or add it to scrambled eggs for extra fluffiness.

text Where we started
The story of Domestos started in a garden shed in Newcastle, in the north of England, in 1929. It was the brainchild of 25-year-old dental mechanic William Handley who sold his solution of sodium hypochlorite door to door for use as a steriliser, drain cleaner and even a treatment for sore feet (not recommended anymore).
By 1952 Domestos was gaining significant market momentum and being sold nationally through retail outlets, marketed under the slogan ‘Kills all known germs’ – a catchphrase that is still synonymous with the brand today.
In 1961 Unilever acquired Domestos and expansion began in all senses of the word.
The start of the new millennium saw the launch of a flurry of new formulations, starting in 2003 with the brand’s thickest-ever product, Domestos Oxygen bleach, followed in 2004 by the bold new Pink Power, and in 2005 with Aqua Blast.
The following years would see Domestos expanding its portfolio to new formats with innovations like Domestos Sink & Pipe Unblocker, Total Blast Toilet Gel, Germ Blaster and Rim Blocks.
How’s it going
Today Domestos boasts a wide portfolio that includes bathroom sprays, kitchen products and floor cleaner, as well as its core range of toilet cleaners.
Unlike many of its competitors that offer acid-based cleaners, Domestos’s bleach-based formula allows it to deliver impressive cleaning performance while also being 100% biodegradable.
Thanks to both the superiority of the products and range available, Domestos has seen its business double in size in the last ten years. Sold in over 45 countries under a variety of names, including Domex in India and Vim in Argentina, Domestos is leading in nearly all the markets where it operates.
Thanks to both the superiority of the products and range available, Domestos has seen its business double in size in the last ten years.
The introduction of Domestos in Turkey in the early 2000s effectively converted the market to the merits of thick bleach, with turnover increasing sixfold in the last ten years. Vietnam has also seen huge market growth over the last decade, with Domestos acquiring 50% penetration, while South Africa’s business has tripled, also in the last decade.
“Domestos’s success in the markets is undoubtedly linked to performance superiority and consumer trust in a product that will get the job done,” says Shuchi Suri, Head of Household Cleaning & Hygiene at Unilever. “Efficacy, convenience and maintenance are the key innovation drivers for the brand, and new products have increasingly provided solutions to localised issues.”
For example, Domestos has introduced market innovations based on different toilet and water types in Vietnam and India, including products enhanced with surface modification technology (see more below) that keeps toilets clean and odour free for up to 72 hours.
But it is not just new products that are powering Domestos’s growth, the brand is also continuously improving existing ones. Domestos introduced its first toilet block in the 1990s and has been stepping up its power ever since. The new Power 5 block, for example, is now longer lasting – delivering fragrance and cleaning power for up to 300 flushes.
The purpose that powers it
Supporting public health has been an inherent part of the Domestos legacy, dating back to the 1950s when it was involved in the UK public health campaign supporting polio vaccination.
So it is not surprising that when the Covid pandemic hit, Domestos carelines in the UK and worldwide lit up with consumers asking what products to use to kill coronavirus and how to disinfect their home.
“It was clear at that point that we needed to step in and complement the advice of government and public health bodies,” says Peter ter Kulve, President, Unilever Home Care. “We did this by partnering with Dr Lisa Ackerley, who was able to provide the general public with practical cleaning information, regardless of the brand they use.”
But Domestos’s purpose to support public health reaches well beyond Covid. Through its ten-year partnership with UNICEF and its own ‘Cleaner Toilets, Brighter Futures’ (CTBF) school O&M toilet programme (for operation & maintenance), Domestos has to date helped 29 million people get access to a clean and safe toilet and has committed to helping 100 million people by 2030 (see below, Purpose: All Toilets Are Gold).
Brand new idea
Purpose: All Toilets Are Gold
For over ten years Domestos has been working to make clean toilets a reality for everyone, not the privilege of the few. Now Domestos is calling for all toilets to be cared for as though they were precious gold.
“A toilet is easily taken for granted,” explains Shuchi. “But one in three primary schools worldwide don’t have a useable toilet. Domestos’s own global research found that nine in ten children face issues with their school toilets, both in developed and emerging markets, impacting them physically and emotionally.”
The challenge of helping everyone gain access to safe sanitation is two-fold: simply having toilets and then keeping them in use. Despite mass toilet-building efforts over the last ten years, 3.6 billion people still do not have access to a clean safe toilet.
Without ongoing maintenance, toilets start dropping out of use as soon as they’re built and the gap in access gets wider. Domestos is working to stop this pointless loss by showing how a small investment in maintenance can keep toilets in use for longer.
“The focus of the last decade has been on toilet building,” says Shuchi. “But now the evidence shows that building toilets alone is not enough. We have to turn the spotlight on the benefit of MAINTAINING them and the consequences of not doing so.”
Packaging: The greener blue bottle
Domestos bottles have been recyclable for some time. However, in August 2022, Domestos went a step further in the UK by relaunching the core 750ml bleach range, with bottles made from 50% post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR). 1 Made from high-quality recycled resin to ensure the bottle is strong and durable, the change is set to save 1,505 tonnes of virgin plastic per year 2 without losing on the distinctive colours of the brand packaging.
Claire Racklyeft, Home & Hygiene Category Lead, Unilever UK&I, comments: “We know it’s important to shoppers that big brands take action to tackle plastic waste, so we’re already working towards bottles made with 100% recycled plastic.” The move is part of the larger Unilever’s Home Care Clean Future commitment to fundamentally change the way that some of the world’s best-known cleaning and laundry products offer superior cleaning, sustainability by design and affordability for the many.

Product: Innovation
Addressing consumer pain points has fuelled many innovations, including the introduction of a new fresh guard formula to tackle the issue of odour and limescale in India. By creating a non-stick protective layer on toilets that prevents both stains and germs from building up, the new formula kept toilets odour free for up to three days. In blind tests, the product beat the market leader for the first time in the history of the brand in India.
It might surprise you to learn…
It was Domestos that successfully campaigned to help get World Toilet Day ratified as a UN day back in 2013. The brand also founded the Toilet Board Coalition with Lixil and Kimberly-Clark to champion the value of the private sector in tackling sanitation challenges.

text On 27 October, we announced strong growth results for Quarter Three 2022, with 10.6% underlying sales growth and 17.8% turnover growth compared to the same period last year.
This set of results marks the first time we have reported on our performance since restructuring as five new Business Groups.
Unilever CEO Alan Jope said: “We have delivered double-digit underlying sales growth and are raising our growth outlook for the year despite the obvious challenges of the macro-economic environment. The growth was broad-based, with all five Business Groups contributing, and volumes continuing to hold up well.”
He added: “Our organisation is now better structured to deliver consistent growth through a simpler, more category-focused operating model. The full benefits will be realised over time, and we are seeing encouraging early signs of improved accountability and faster decision-making.”
Here’s a deeper dive into Q3 highlights from each Business Group, and how innovation from our brands is driving this positive momentum.
Beauty & Wellbeing
Within our Beauty & Wellbeing Business Group, the Hair Care category saw high single-digit growth in Q3, largely driven by Latin America and South Asia with strong price contributions from our Sunsilk and Clear brands.
In Skin Care, Vaseline and Pond’s delivered strong growth, supported by innovations with additional consumer benefits. Read more about some of Vaseline’s recent innovations here.
Our Prestige beauty brands also performed well as Hourglass continued its expansion into China through online and premium retail sales, and Living Proof entered the bond-building premium hair category.

Home Care
In Home Care, our Fabric Cleaning category delivered good results in India, Brazil, Turkey and Vietnam and sales growth in Europe and China. Our OMO and Radiant brands contributed strongly for another quarter. Read about how our Dirt is Good laundry brands launched their most sustainable capsules here.
Our Fabric Enhancers category reported double-digit growth for Q3. Our Comfort brand saw great results from its relaunch with a longer-lasting fragrances and new technology designed to better protect clothes from damage.
The Home & Hygiene market declined in Q3 as consumers’ disinfecting habits slowed down post-pandemic, but this part of the business still delivered single-digit growth.
Nutrition
The biggest category in this Business Group, Scratch Cooking Aids, reported high single-digit in Q3. South-East Asia, Africa and North America performed strongly, led by our Knorr brand.
Our business-to-business arm, Unilever Food Solutions, recovered to pre-Covid volume levels and is now well ahead on sales.
Our Dressings category had a very strong quarter, supported by continued growth from Hellmann’s, particularly in the United States. Read more about how Hellmann’s is growing here.
Ice Cream
Our Ice Cream category grew strongly in Q3, with out-of-home sales continuing to recover after the pandemic.
Sales in Europe benefitted from a strong summer season, and Turkey delivered very good growth despite the high-inflation pressure on consumers.

text This Human Rights Day, we’re delighted to share that Unilever has again ranked first – out of 127 companies – in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, as assessed by the World Benchmarking Alliance.
We’re proud of this acknowledgement, but we’re well aware that more needs to be done to progress our own scores and to support the improvement of our peers’ results, as we collectively seek to address ongoing endemic human rights issues in global value chains.
Promoting human rights encompasses many different things
Human rights advocacy is often associated with protests and politics. But in practice, actions seeking to ensure freedom, equity and safety for all can look quite different.
For example, on one hand, they can be about ensuring that all workers are paid fair wages and work reasonable hours, free from harassment and abuse. On the other, they can be about respecting the rights and title to property and land.
Our new Responsible Partner Policy
At Unilever, we rely on a global ecosystem of over 66,000 partners who supply us with goods and services, or distribute and sell our finished products. Despite our commitment to such a huge network of third parties, we won’t just work with anyone.
We use our scale and reach to respect and promote human rights by working only with like-minded partners who can meet our terms of trade. Since 2014, we’ve communicated these requirements through our supplier-facing Responsible Sourcing Policy and our distributor and customer-facing Responsible Business Partner Policy. As the demands of people and planet evolve, we’re evolving too, streamlining our efforts and updating our requirements to ensure they continue to advance human rights in today’s world.
That’s why, on 8 December, we launched our new Responsible Partner Policy (RPP). This brings together our two existing policies to create a single policy which outlines our commitment to responsible business with respect for human rights as its foundation, particularly in the context of modern-day challenges for society and our planet.
The mandatory requirements outlined in our RPP are just the starting point. Ideally, we want our partners to move beyond these minimum thresholds, towards leading practices that can be shared and scaled to deliver widespread industry transformation.
As our Chief Procurement Officer Willem Uijen explains: “These are really the minimum standards we expect of our business partners and, alone, they won’t be enough to generate the meaningful transformation we seek. That’s why our RPP also encourages the development of leading practices – novel, scalable solutions – that can generate new levels of positive change in society.”
The living wage promise
One of the fundamental principles of our RPP is for all workers to be paid fair wages. As part of this, we want to see partners paying a living wage, so we’ve made doing so a ‘Future Mandatory Requirement’ which we expect our partners to prepare for.
As a business, we have committed to ensuring everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever will earn at least a living wage or a living income by 2030. To support and track partner efforts, we launched the Living Wage/Living Income Promise in 2021, through which we share our own living wage journey and offer guidance to those intent on joining our efforts to improving lives and livelihoods and strengthening business resilience.
Similarly, Unilever’s Supplier Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Promise invites partners to demonstrate that addressing the social inequality in our value chains is of paramount importance to them.
For humans to thrive, nature must too
Respect for human rights underpins all Unilever’s Compass goals. Whether we’re committing to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste, or improving health and wellbeing, it’s all driven by a respect for human rights.
One way we’re using nature-based solutions to advance social equity is through our rural dairy farmers initiative in India. In collaboration with on-the-ground experts, Mooo Farms, we’re working to reach 1,000 farmers across eight villages who supply milk to Unilever’s dairy supplier in Nabha, Patiala, in Punjab.
Together, we’re helping to share knowledge and implement best practices to improve cattle health and welfare and boost milk yields. In doing so, we hope to boost farmer incomes, lift dairy farming households out of poverty and ​reduce GHG emissions. Our aim is that, by 2025, we can cover over 3,000 farmers across several Indian districts and increase dairy farmer income by 35%.
Not only are initiatives like this the right thing to do, but they also lead to a better performing company and better performing employees.
“It’s time for us all to consider what stretching ambitions we can set to deliver meaningful change,” says Willem. “Sure, we must get the basics right first in our homes, workplaces and communities, but if that’s all we do, future humanity will still be left wanting.”
text When it comes to sustainable palm oil, we want our work to benefit everyone in the areas we source from - including smallholder farmers and civil society; forests and wildlife; and governments, businesses and communities.
That’s why we’re supporting landscape programmes within Southeast Asia – in the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau and Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Sabah, Malaysia.
In a landscape approach, all stakeholders are united behind a shared vision of sustainable development, where the needs of the environment and communities are balanced. This collaborative mandate recognises that no single organisation, company or group of people alone can achieve what’s possible when everyone works together.
Today, we publish a report (PDF 14.04 MB) (Opens in a pop-up window )which offers fresh insights into our work in this area, detailing the progress we have made alongside our partners, as well as the learnings we’ve discovered along the way. By sharing our approach and impact to date, we hope to inspire others to join our journey.
The need for holistic solutions
We’re involved with these landscapes because they form part of our supply chain, have existing government commitments to sustainability, and offer clear opportunities for us to protect the forests and ecosystems, and support the surrounding communities.
By working alongside those who know the land best – local communities, governments and NGOs – towards common goals, we can help reimagine the role that palm oil can play in their landscapes.
As Willem Uijen, our Chief Procurement Officer, says: “We’re investing in landscape programmes because it’s clear that the challenges related to climate, nature and social equity are deeply interconnected and require holistic solutions. Working with our partners, we are helping to empower smallholder farmers, protect and restore forests, support governments in creating the sustainable development they seek, and progress our own sustainability goals.”

Here’s a quick snapshot of two of the programmes featured in the report.
Protecting the Leuser Ecosystem with IDH and FKL
Indonesia’s Aceh province is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains part of the largest intact tropical rainforest in Sumatra – the 2.6-million-hectare Leuser Ecosystem – which is the last place on earth where endangered wildlife, including the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceroses and elephants, can be found in the same area. With our partners IDH and the Leuser Conservation Forum (FKL), we’re helping to protect this forest.
We’re equipping the programme with Radar Alerts for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) satellite technology to help monitor – and verify – deforestation faster. Working through a multistakeholder forum, we’re helping to develop a response protocol for when deforestation alerts are received. And we’re working with farmers to restore the Leuser Ecosystem through agroforestry and nature regeneration schemes.
We’re also helping farmers obtain official documentation so they can apply for RSPO certification. This means they can increase the income they generate from their existing farmland, because certified sustainable crops command a higher price in the market. This in turn reduces pressure on the land as the farmers have less need to expand into the forest.

Supporting Sabah’s wildlife alongside WWF

The Malaysian state of Sabah is rich in forests and wildlife, and is also one of the country’s largest producers of palm oil by volume, some of which enters our supply chain.
We support the World Wide Fund for Nature’s (WWF) Sabah Landscapes programme, which forms part of a wider, government-led effort. We support forest restoration in Tawau, Kinabatangan and Lower Sugut, two of three orangutan and elephant habitats and riverside areas covered by the programme.
Through our work with WWF and other funders, we also support ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation' (NDPE) training and help prepare smallholders and outgrowers – unorganised smallholder farmers with domestic and international buyers – for RSPO and MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) certification.

Working towards our Protect and Regenerate Nature goals
We’re committed to building a deforestation-free supply chain in palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023, to protecting and regenerating 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030, and to sustainably sourcing 100% of our key agricultural crops, including palm oil.
But we know we can’t achieve these stretching ambitions alone. Only by collaborating with others can we accelerate and scale the work required to overcome systemic environmental and social challenges. For this reason, landscape programmes are key to our approach to making sustainable living commonplace.
text The world must halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But rather than delivering the deep cuts needed, current plans equate to a 10% rise in emissions by 2030, putting the world on track for 2.5°C warming, and leaving billions of people, nature and our economies exposed to the risks of an unstable climate.
Yet climate change isn’t a future problem. Climate impacts are already affecting people, businesses and societies today. This year has seen catastrophic flooding in Pakistan and the Philippines, droughts and a food crisis in East Africa, and extreme heatwaves and wildfires in Europe, the US and China. 1.3 million people have been displaced by nationwide flooding in Nigeria. And the people suffering most are among the most vulnerable in society, who have done the least to contribute towards climate change.
COP27, the UN climate summit that will be held in Egypt this month, is an opportunity to close the gap between what the science says we need to do and what is being implemented today. Governments must lead the way by setting more ambitious plans with early action, by providing finance to help developing countries decarbonise and build resilience to climate change impacts, and by making policy changes that will allow businesses to play their full part in delivering on the higher targets that have been set.
What do we want global leaders to do at COP27?
An important part of Unilever’s own climate work is using our voice and influence for good. At COP27, we’re asking governments to take more ambitious climate action and start building resilience for the future by:
Setting out stronger national plans with more ambitious targets that accelerate action
Ensuring a fair and just transition to a net zero future by unlocking finance and investment for decarbonisation and resilience in developing countries
Putting in place policy frameworks that secure sustainable food and energy systems
What the world needs now...
Keep increasing ambition and action
Some of the world’s largest economies have taken significant steps forward on climate since COP26, but the overall speed and scale of action isn’t enough. That’s why Unilever is asking governments to maximise investments in natural and technological solutions, such as protecting forests that regulate the climate and innovating new technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it permanently. We’re also pressing for policy frameworks that allow businesses everywhere to set ambitious and credible roadmaps, by providing clarity on net zero standards and definitions, and incentives to invest in climate action.
Unlock finance for decarbonisation and climate resilience 
Failing to invest in poorer countries will impact growth and supply chains globally and will leave the most vulnerable communities at greater risk from climate change. At COP26, developed countries promised to double adaptation finance by 2025 but progress is slow and more needs to be done. There is a clear need to improve how governments scale investment to achieve climate and sustainable development goals. We’re asking governments to elevate the importance of investing in resilience globally in addition to accelerating decarbonisation efforts, because only a truly global and fair transition will deliver the outcomes we need.
Secure sustainable food and energy systems
Transitioning to sustainable food and energy systems are key priorities for COP27, allowing us to drastically reduce global emissions while increasing food and energy access and security. We’re advocating for sustainable, resilient food systems to address unprecedented, accelerating pressures that are already disrupting production and threatening food security. By redirecting environmentally harmful subsidies, the money can be used to support the adoption of regenerative agriculture and the shift towards healthy and sustainable, plant-based diets. We’re also pushing for a broad-based, accelerated transition to renewables to ensure energy access and energy security in a carbon-constrained world.
Why is COP27 relevant to business?
According to a 2020 survey of global economists, the world could experience a 10% reduction in GDP if we continue with business as usual.
At Unilever, we know climate change poses a profound risk to our business, through impacts on global supply chains, food security, water access and on the communities we serve. Already, extreme weather events have disrupted global supply chains, and adversely affected the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.
Over the coming years, climate change is likely to further impact crop yields and increase sourcing costs. Increasing water scarcity could affect our consumers’ ability to use our products.
Businesses must be part of the solution but can’t do it alone. We need policy frameworks that provide clarity and credibility, and incentivise clean growth and investment in low-carbon innovation and building resilience.~
Unilever is determined to play its part
We believe that the businesses putting sustainability and climate at the heart of their investment plans, in line with growing demands to do so from investors and consumers alike, will be the ones to ultimately prosper.
That’s why we’re working hard to decarbonise our operations and value chain and to increase food system resilience through regenerative agricultural practices that protect nature.
Our Future Foods commitments are working to transform global food systems and reduce the impact of waste. Our Home Care business is replacing fossil-fuel-derived carbon in our formulations with renewable or recycled carbon by 2030 – a move estimated to save product emissions by up to 20%. Together, our brands are investing €1 billion in climate and nature projects between 2020–2030. And we’re taking our biggest step yet with our suppliers, asking them to halve their emissions this decade.
We have a lot more to do to reach our climate goals, but we’re confident we can do it. We were one of the first companies in the world to put our decarbonisation plan to a shareholder vote, supported by 99.6% of the votes cast.
We were also proud to be a Principal Partner of COP26 last year, when countries made stronger commitments to keep warming below 1.5°C and to move from negotiation to implementation. But while some of the world’s largest economies have taken significant steps forward, global action still doesn’t meet the speed and scale required to avert the worst impacts of climate change.
Collaboration is key
No single company, value chain or industry can deliver the transition we need to tackle climate change. We need cross-sectoral initiatives and system-level policy changes that can shift entire economies to be low-carbon and climate-resilient, and governments must be bold enough to lead the way.
There is scope for more radical collaboration between governments, and between governments and businesses, that can accelerate such system-level changes.
We want to contribute to the scale-up of public-private-civil society partnerships that can help governments to deliver on their international commitments and help businesses to deliver on their net zero targets. The more readily available and affordable that renewables become, the faster our suppliers will be able to decarbonise, helping us to reach our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2039.
The time is now
The IPCC warned this year that the window for setting the world on course for a secure, liveable climate is rapidly closing.
If the world is really going to tackle this crisis, the most serious long-term threat that we all face, then we need more honesty about the challenges we’re facing and more co-creation of the solutions. We need coordinated public policy, public and private finance, and corporate action that builds public support for big, rapid, real economy changes that can deliver a just transition.
We will only accelerate system change at the speed and scale needed if countries and business act together, and act now.

text How it started
Rexona was created by Australian physician Alice Sheffer back in 1908 in Australia. Alice’s husband was SF Sheffer, the founder of the Sheldon Drug Company, and her Rexona personal care ointment quickly became the firm’s top-selling product.
In the 1930s, Lever Brothers – one of the founding companies soon to become Unilever – purchased Rexona, with the aim of expanding the brand beyond its Australian roots. Finland was the first stop in the 1960s, and the rest of the world soon followed in the 1980s, with Rexona launched across the globe under the brand names Sure, Degree, Shield and Rexena.
How it’s going
Rexona is at the forefront of bringing game-changing technology to the market and delivering on the high expectations of consumers.
In 2021, Rexona relaunched its core range globally, upgrading antiperspirants with the brand’s unique, patented body-responsive technology to provide 72 hours of non-stop sweat and odour protection.
Rexona is now the world’s No.1 antiperspirant and deodorant brand (verified by NielsenIQ), sold in more than 100 countries, and one of 13 billion-euro brands in Unilever’s portfolio, with sales valued at more than €1 billion a year.
The purpose that powers it
Rexona believes in the power of movement to transform lives and it’s on a mission to inspire everyone to move more.
As part of this, the brand is challenging society’s narrow limits of what an acceptable mover looks like, to make movement inclusive for all.
Through its Breaking Limits programme, Rexona is equipping young people, especially those in disadvantaged communities, with the confidence and opportunity to move however they want.
The brand is partnering with NGO Beyond Sport and a network of recognised NGOs that run sport for development programmes to scale up this work and provide young people with greater access to sports and coaching. The programme has already reached more than 600,000 young people and supported more than 9,000 coaches, community leaders and volunteers.
Rexona is expanding its Breaking Limits programme into schools in the UK this year, with a host of fun, inclusive and accessible lesson plans and in-classroom activities that will equip students with the confidence to move. The programme, which will be up and running in schools from this month, will take a fresh approach to challenging the barriers that can stand in the way of students being active.
Brand new ideas
The science behind 72-hour sweat protection
Rexona’s ads have long claimed ‘It won’t let you down’. Now that promise lasts longer than ever, thanks to the unique, patented technology developed in Unilever’s labs.
Across its range, Rexona now features 72-hour non-stop protection from sweat and odour. More than 60 Unilever scientists performed over 200 clinical tests to measure the impact of microtechnology on sweat and malodour reduction and came up with a formula that delivers an extremely effective barrier.
Read an interview with two of our experts about this innovation here.
Breaking Limits 
Rexona’s Breaking Limits programme was launched to equip young people with critical life skills such as confidence, teamwork and resilience. The brand provides access to supportive coaches and mentors, entry to sports-based programmes and safe places to move, working with local non-profit organisations through NGO Beyond Sport.
Read more about the partnership here.
Designed for inclusion
In 2021, Degree started on a journey towards inclusive product design. Working with a diverse team of experts, the brand developed a prototype – Degree Inclusive, the world’s first adaptive deodorant.
Its hooked container, improved grip and magnetic ‘click’ closures are designed to make the prototype easier to hold and handle, and instructions on the label are printed in braille.
“As a brand that’s committed to inspiring confidence in everyone to move more, Degree believes no one should be held back from breaking a sweat and enjoying the transformative benefits of movement,” said Kathryn Swallow, Global Brand Vice President.
“More than 60 million people in the US live with a disability, yet products and experiences are still not designed with this community in mind. With Degree Inclusive, we hope to inspire bold action across the industry to ensure that people with disabilities have an equal playing field.”
It might surprise you to learn…
In April 2022, Rexona (under its Degree brand) launched the world’s first marathon in the metaverse. The Degree Metathon invited Decentraland visitors to take part in the virtual event in a space entirely free from real-world physical limitations and societal stereotypes.
Avatars had the opportunity to try Decentraland’s first adaptive wearables such as prostheses, running blades and wheelchairs – all designed to offer greater representation to people with disabilities.

A candle only gains by lighting another.” Javaria emphasised “To truly make the session effective, we must bring together people at both tiers of the funnel of learning i.e. the academia and the industry professionals and hear what they have to say. I hope that this unique blend that has seldom been brought together at a single forum ever in Pakistan helps make our discussions even more worthwhile.”
Ali Tariq, CFO Unilever Pakistan mentioned "I am delighted that we have realised our vision to pioneer a first ever platform in Pakistan, for CFOs to come together to share their finance best practices, steal from each other with pride and thus raise the bar for the wider finance profession in Pakistan.”
Shazia Syed, Chairperson Unilever Pakistan & Imran Khalil, Regional Board Member CIMA were also present during the event and stressed on bringing diversity within finance & corporate functions and appreciated the opportunity of networking through these summits.
Best practices were shared by 8 CFOs of major companies and key note speakers included Abdul Rab - CFO Reckitt Benckiser, Khalid Noor – CFO Novartis, Abdul Samad – CFO Glaxo SmithKline, Ali Tariq – CFO Unilever and Asad Shariff – CFO Standard Chartered Bank.
Naz Khan, CFO Engro Corp. addressed the audience as a guest speaker on women in finance leadership roles.
Senior representatives from top academic and professional institutes including ACCA, IBA, CFA Institute, IoBM & ICAP attended the workshop and actively contributed to the discussion. The workshop ended with a panel discussion on the role of finance in the fast paced digital world. The initiative was appreciated and great response was received from both corporate and academic sectors.
text Unilever has added one of the world’s first heavy-duty electric trucks to our fleet, marking an important milestone in our move towards zero emission vehicles.
The 44-tonne Volvo truck, which will run entirely on renewable power, is the first heavy-duty electric vehicle with sufficient range to meet our business need of transporting goods from our distribution centres to retail customers – and the first such vehicle to hit the road in the Netherlands.
The truck has a 540 kWh battery capacity, which is equal to more than seven average electric passenger cars, and it can travel up to 185 miles on a single charge.
‘Greening’ our journeys
To help reach our value chain goal of net zero by 2039, we’ve identified measures which we believe will help cut greenhouse gas emissions from our logistics network by 40–50% by 2030. Switching to electric vehicles where we can is a core part of that.
Our logistics sustainability strategy has two key objectives. One is reducing the distances we need to drive in our distribution. The other is ‘greening’ the miles we can’t avoid driving – and that’s where the new truck will be a game-changer.
When charged with green, renewable electricity at our distribution centre, it’s a zero-emission vehicle, reducing up to 100 tonnes of carbon per year compared to a regular diesel truck. And there are other benefits too. Not only is the electric truck far less polluting, it’s also much quieter than a diesel-powered vehicle – good for the environment and for drivers’ working conditions.
This truck won’t get far on an empty battery, so we’ve invested in setting up high-power charging infrastructure at our Tiel distribution centre in the Netherlands, ensuring we can keep the vehicle’s electric battery topped up and charge more trucks that we plan to add to our fleet in the future. Adding charging facilities at existing sites is a challenge, impacted by both warehouse design and grid capacity, but we’re working on it and are learning a lot from this project. Any new warehouses we open in the future will need to include electric vehicle charging as standard.
“Electrification of our transport and distribution activities is at the heart of Unilever’s logistics sustainability strategy. This launch represents a significant step forward in putting that strategy into action and marks a milestone towards more and more electrification in Europe,” says Michelle Grose, Unilever Head of Global Logistics.
“We’re delighted to be one of the first companies to use this new truck, and to be working with our trusted transport partners Kuehne+Nagel and Simon Loos as we start this journey,” she adds.
“We are excited about this partnership,” says Anna Müller, SVP, Europe North & Central at Volvo Trucks. “Starting with the introduction of the very first heavy electric truck in Unilever’s transport system will provide valuable insights and constitutes a great basis for an extended collaboration in the future.”
Boosting demand for electric trucks
Back in 2017, Unilever became the first fast-moving consumer goods organisation to join The Climate Group’s EV100 initiative, which brings together companies committed to switching to electric vehicles by 2030.
As one of ten founding members of EV100, we pledged to transition to electric vehicles across the fleets that we own or lease by 2030. More than 120 companies have since joined, agreeing to the same goal.
Now we’re proud to be one of five founding businesses joining the launch of EV100+. This new collaborative group comprises companies who aim to phase out the heaviest and most polluting vehicles on the roads. Because while we’ve committed to transitioning more of our transport to electric vehicles, we can only do so if there are suitable alternatives on the market.
Together with IKEA, JSW Steel, Maersk and DPD, we have committed to transition our fleet of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes (known as medium- and heavy-duty vehicles or MHDVs) to zero emissions vehicles by 2040 across 38 OECD markets as well as China and India. The EV100+ members will also help to send a clear signal to vehicle manufacturers and policy-makers that business demand for zero emissions MHDVs is growing fast.
“Businesses are willing to lead”
“MHDVs represent the final frontier of zero emission road transportation, and EV100+ will tackle the heaviest, most polluting vehicles across the world,” says Sandra Roling, Director of Transport at the Climate Group.
“We have seen over the last five years how EV100 has acted as a powerful catalyst for change across light-duty vehicle fleets. Now it’s time for EV100+ to drive this change across global MHDV fleets as well. We know the technology is ready, and businesses are willing to lead.”

text Our ice cream brands have been serving treats and smiles to consumers for 100 years. And while the classic vanilla and chocolate combo is still adored across our entire portfolio, today’s ice cream lovers are keen to experiment. Here’s how we create innovations that deliver.
With people increasingly turning to vitamins, minerals and supplements for a more holistic approach to their health and wellbeing, we explore why this represents a significant opportunity for Unilever.
We must work together with our suppliers to tackle their greenhouse gas emissions in order to bring our own to net zero. Stella Constantatos, Senior Manager in our Business Operations Sustainability team, explains why.
Getting it done was the theme of Climate Week at UNGA in New York. That goal is more pressing than ever. To hit net zero by 2050, climate economists say the world needs to invest 2–3%* of GDP each year. It’s a big ask, but the world could experience -10% off GDP if we don’t.
From heat pumps to renewables, Lewis Rae, Unilever’s Safety, Health, and Environment Capabilities Manager for Air Emissions, explains how we’re decarbonising our operations.
Find out how we’re working to lower the climate impact of the ice cream industry.
Our focus on driving bigger, better and more impactful innovation delivered over €1 billion of incremental turnover in 2021, double the delivery in 2020. Here are just a few examples of our innovation in action.
As part of our Climate Transition Action Plan, we’re switching 100% of our energy to renewable sources by 2030. Read on to discover five ways we’re taking action on this challenge.

text Karachi, 2 July 2020: Unilever Pakistan announced Glow & Lovely as the new name for the Fair & Lovely brand.
This is the next step in the evolution of its skin care portfolio to a more inclusive vision of ‘Positive Beauty’. Over the next few months, Glow & Lovely will be on the shelves and future innovations will deliver on this new proposition.
In 2019, the brand’s communication moved away from benefits of fairness, whitening and skin lightening, towards glow, even tone, skin clarity and radiance which are holistic measures of healthy skin. The brand has never been and is not a bleaching product.
The brand is committed to celebrating all skin tones, which will be reflected in the rebranded product’s communications and messaging.

text We’re raising targets for our nutritional portfolio by 10% to accelerate its impact on public health.
The new target is for 85% of our servings to meet Unilever’s Science-based Nutrition Criteria (USNC) by 2028.
"The criteria are an evolution of our HNS,” says Global Head of Diet & Health Standards for Nutrition and Ice Cream, Julie Willems. “USNC consist of product-specific criteria that look at the role of the product in the diet and sets thresholds for calories, sugar, salt and saturated fat.
“Using these insights, we believe we can best drive reformulation and innovation across our portfolio in Ice Cream and Nutrition. We have also introduced sugar standards for all our product categories, including savoury products, complementing those we already have in place for ice cream and beverages,” she adds.
Science-based targets developed from dietary intake data
The science-based targets developed for USNC were underpinned using data from dietary intake surveys which reflect the actual eating patterns of more than 110,000 people across five markets – UK, France, Brazil, US and China.
In all markets, the findings published in the scientific journal, Nutrients, confirm that a reduction in intake of calories, saturated fat, sugar and salt would be achieved using our criteria. Unilever evaluated a number of externally endorsed Nutrient Profile Models and concluded that Unilever’s Science-based Nutrition Criteria can have the most positive impact on public health.
Moving forward our Future Foods Commitments
Our 85% goal for servings and evolved USNC will be used to accelerate our Future Foods Commitments which include targets for plant-based sales, a reduction of salt, sugar and calories, and increased sales of healthier ‘positive nutrition’ products.
Moving forward, we look to the industry and stakeholders to work together to create an industry-wide standard Nutrient Profile Model that every company in the food industry can report to, to incentivise reformulation at scale in order to enhance the impact on public health.

text The science is clear: to safely limit a global temperature rise to 1.5°C, the world needs to reach net zero by mid-century and at least halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade.
Businesses need to play their part in making this happen – faster than ever before. At Unilever, we’ve already taken strides in our operations, lowering emissions by 68% since 2015. But as this only accounts for a small proportion of our total footprint, we know we need to act well beyond our factory walls.
That’s why we are working with our partners and using technology and innovation to address emissions across our wider value chain. We’re supporting key suppliers to measure and cut carbon, collaborating with our brands to invest in nature and developing innovative ways to reduce the footprint of our products before they reach shops and consumers.
We know we’ve still got a long way to go, but we’re committed to reaching net zero by 2039 and as we work towards our climate targets, we want to celebrate some of the many experts at Unilever who are driving change across our business.
Read on to learn ten ways we’re tackling emissions, from the people making it happen.
1. Investing in climate and nature
In 2020, Unilever established our Climate & Nature Fund, with the goal of investing €1 billion this decade in projects that will accelerate decarbonisation and support nature solutions globally. Eric Soubeiran, Vice President of Business Operations, Sustainability, and Managing Director of the fund, is ensuring our brands are investing in projects that have positive impact. For example, Dove’s partnership with the Rimba Collective will help protect and restore 50,000 hectares of rainforest – an area eight times the size of Manhattan – in South-East Asia over five years.
“We want the €1 billion to be used in projects that drive change and will attract partners to help us to co-finance and scale solutions. That way, we can achieve at least double the contribution we’ve made.”
Read more on how we are investing in climate and nature 
2. Scaling up our climate collaboration with suppliers
More than 70% of our emissions come from the raw materials, ingredients and packaging that we buy. Giulia Saladino, a Climate Specialist in our Business Operations Sustainability team, is working with the suppliers who contribute most significantly to our upstream emissions, supporting them to monitor and reduce their product carbon footprint, so we can reduce ours too.
“We have around 52,000 suppliers. Of these, 300 contribute significantly to our upstream emissions. When we began researching how to work with them on emissions reduction, we discovered that two-thirds of this group didn’t have a climate target yet. This presented a huge opportunity for Unilever to offer support.”

3. Delivering dairy that doesn’t cost the earth
We’re reducing cow burps by using red seaweed as cattle feed and heating homes with their manure. Our Sustainable Sourcing Manager for Dairy, Klaas Jan van Calker, highlights some of the more unusual ways Unilever projects are reducing emissions in the dairy sector.
“If you look into the ingredients that contribute to Unilever’s overall footprint, then dairy is significant, especially in ice cream. We know reducing those emissions must be a key part of Unilever’s solution for tackling climate change.”
Read more on how we are delivering dairy that doesn't cost the earth 
4. Using innovation to cut carbon in cleaning products
Jon Hague, Head of Clean Future, Science and Technology for Home Care, explains how we’re using chemical innovation to reduce the carbon footprint of our cleaning products, from developing nature-based foaming agents to creating ingredients that can even help trap carbon in the soil.
“As materials biodegrade, they release carbon dioxide into the air. We can tackle that by working with suppliers to drive down a material’s initial carbon footprint, using biodegradable and renewable carbon, and through ‘weight efficiency’ or eco-design.”
Read more on how we are using innovation to cut carbon in cleaning products 
5. Decarbonising our factories
We’ve committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity in our operations and we’ve made strong progress. All the grid electricity used by our factories is already drawn from renewable sources. Lewis Rae, our Safety, Health and Environment Capabilities Manager for Air Emissions, reveals the steps we’re taking next to optimise our factories to use cleaner, smarter energy.
"We need to focus on energy efficiency because the most sustainable energy is the energy that we don’t use at all. Doing so also makes sense for our business – we estimate that since 2008, energy efficiency has saved Unilever well over €1 billion."
Read more on how we are decarbonising our factories 
6. Harnessing heat pumps
As well as providing heat and hot water in our factories, thermal energy sources can be used during production processes, like pasteurisation for our ice cream, and for cleaning processing equipment in our machinery. Vivek Nesarikar, Global Engineering Manager, explains how heat pumps are changing the way we source thermal energy, allowing us to repurpose waste heat and cutting costs and emissions.
“In total, over a third of our thermal energy use is currently drawn from renewable sources. To meet our target of achieving 100% renewable heat by 2030, we will be looking to significantly increase our use of heat pumps across our operations.”
Read more on how we are harnessing heat pumps 
7. Turning the tide towards more sustainable shipping
We move around 150,000 shipping containers a year, so at any point in time there are in the region of 10,000 Unilever containers in the sea. Director of International Logistics and Decarbonisation, Sundarrajan Bhyravan, helps manage this. From a virtual control tower that allows us to monitor shipping emissions in real time to our work to effect wider system change, he explains how we’re making our shipping more sustainable.
“For Unilever, ocean shipments account for a very small share of our logistics emissions, which in turn account for just 3% of our overall emissions. But climate change is a problem for everyone and if big companies like us, as cargo owners and shippers, don’t take a lead, then who will?”
Read more on how we are turning the tide towards more sustainable shipping 
8. Driving down logistics emissions
Using a mix of increased efficiency, electric vehicles and sustainably sourced biofuels, we’re cutting emissions across our distribution network. Our Sustainability Logistics Manager, Laura Realpe, explains how only a mix of new technology, better infrastructure and strong partnerships will make decarbonisation of our fleet possible.
“I love the innovation in my role. We are testing things that, at times, are being done for the first time in the world.”
Read more on how we are driving down logistics emissions 
9. Warming up the cold chain
The ‘cold chain’ for ice cream requires refrigerated trucks, chilled sales cabinets and home freezers. Unilever has around 3 million sales freezers globally, so reducing their footprint would be a big win. Roy Horne, Head of Climate Action in our Ice Cream business group, explains how, alongside introducing plant-based ingredients and reducing emissions from dairy, we’re exploring ways to change the way ice cream is stored.
“Our 3 million sales freezers contribute a lot to our footprint. We think you can change the design temperature of ice cream and still give the consumer the same experience, translating to a 20–30% energy saving in the cold chain.”
Read more on how we are warming up the cold chain 
10. Building sustainability into the business
Making significant and meaningful emissions reductions while still driving growth requires businesses to think holistically. As Chief Business Operations and Supply Chain Officer, Reginaldo Ecclissato is guiding our use of technology in our journey towards net zero and working to ensure that every link in our supply chain is strong, sustainable and optimised for growth.
“We’re seeing time and time again that investing in technology not only increases efficiency but also helps us deliver on climate and nature... I would say our long-term partnerships continue to be a key part of our success too.”

text The Covid-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the world, including Pakistan, where the virus has claimed over 6,000 lives and left a far reaching socioeconomic crisis in its wake. Every year, on Independence Day, the sound of the anthem echoes across the country. This year, in light of the Coronavirus, this performance features acclaimed singer Shehzad Roy and an accompanying choir – singing the national anthem as sung through face masks, to highlight the significance of continued focus on safety.
While there is a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, it is important to recognise that the fight is far from over. This moving performance from Shehzad Roy on Independence Day is a powerful and timely statement that aims to inspire Pakistanis to continue to taking proper precautions against the spread of COVID-19 to eliminate the possibility of a second wave.
Presented by Unilever Pakistan, as a public service message, the short and emotionally charged video sees Roy leading the vocals on the anthem with a group of singers, who are all wearing face masks. The anthem appears to have a slightly muffled sound, as vocals usually are, when heard through masks, but it retains the same powerful emotions it is designed to bring alive. The visuals also showcases a diverse image of the country, with Pakistanis from all backgrounds, especially minorities, represented performing the anthem together.
Directed by Zeeshan Parwez and created by Ali Rez and his team at BBDO, the aim of the anthem is to communicate the personal responsibility every Pakistani has, to fight against COVID-19. Amongst recommend safety protocols, wearing a face mask, according to the W.H.O greatly reduces the chances of spread of the virus. This can be further complemented with ensuring hand hygiene and physical distancing. The powerful call-to-action in the performance connects to the first lines in the anthem itself: Pak sur zameen, and leaves the viewer with the hashtag #CoronaSePak
Amir Paracha, Chairman and CEO, Unilever Pakistan, commented: “Unilever Pakistan is committed to its efforts to protect the lives and livelihoods of Pakistanis during this challenging time. With this stirring rendition of the national anthem, we aim to reinforce the importance of continued attention to safe behaviours and inspire Pakistanis to better protect themselves. This performance reminds us it is our collective responsibility and duty to the nation to protect ourselves, each other and our homeland from the threat of this pandemic.
The simple acts of wearing a mask; ensuring hand hygiene and maintaining required physical distancing can help save lives and it is our hope that this message inspires us all to do so.”
text London/Rotterdam - Unilever today celebrated 10 years of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which is now in its tenth and final year. Alan Jope, CEO, reinforced Unilever’s commitment to making sustainable living commonplace for 8 billion people, and called for collective action to ensure that the crises of social inequality and climate are not neglected in the wake of Covid-19.
Speaking at a global virtual event, CEO Alan Jope said, “The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan was a game-changer for our business. Some goals we have met, some we have missed, but we are a better business for trying. It has required immense ingenuity, dedication and collaboration to get to where we are now. We have made very good progress, but there is still more to do.
“The pressures on the planet are getting worse, and social inequality has reached a critical point, being made even more severe by the devastating pandemic we’re living through. These issues are just as urgent as they were before Covid-19 struck, and - like Covid-19 - they will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. More than 700 million people live in extreme poverty, on less than $1.90 a day, and The World Bank estimates that an extra 40 million to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, as a result of Covid-19. The climate crisis risks adding hundreds of millions more.
“Businesses across sectors, governments across continents, NGOs, academics, researchers, scientists… we must all come together. We can’t put climate action on hold. We can’t tell the people who live in poverty to wait. 2020 is the year in which an unthinkable amount of public money is going to be spent in support of getting the economy back on track. But we should not be seeking to get the economy ‘back to normal’. Instead, we must emerge stronger and more resilient than we were before; ready to take decisive and definitive action to look after people and the planet,” added Jope.
“As the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan journey concludes, we will take everything we’ve learned and build on it. We will do more of what has worked well, we will correct what hasn’t, and we will set ourselves new challenges. And while we don’t really know what the world will look like post-Covid-19, I am convinced that there will be no future unless we double down on our commitments to look after people and the planet.
He added, “Before the Covid-19 crisis, it was already clear that the current capitalist model is in need of repair. Globalisation and capitalism are good for a business like ours, but globalisation and capitalism at the expense of people and the planet are not. It’s therefore up to businesses like us, working with partners– NGOs, government organisations, academics, suppliers, customers – to drive a new model of capitalism, and build a better future.”
10 years of Sustainable Living – and the future
Every year, Unilever has reported progress against our targets in our Sustainable Living Report. Some of the achievements include:
Reaching 1.3 billion people through our health and hygiene programmes.
Reducing the total waste footprint per consumer use of our products by 32%, and achieving zero waste to landfill across all our factories.
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own manufacturing by 50%, and achieving 100% renewable grid electricity across our sites.
Reducing sugar across all our sweetened tea-based beverages by 23%, and 56% of our foods portfolio now meets recognised High Nutrition Standards.
Enabling 2.34 million women to access initiatives aiming to promote their safety, develop their skills or expand their opportunities, we've moved towards a gender balanced workplace in which 51% of management roles are held by women.
Rebecca Marmot, Chief Sustainability Officer, explained, “There are many highlights from the last ten years. Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands – which include brands like Dove, Hellmann’s and Domestos – have consistently outperformed the average growth rate of the rest of the portfolio since the metric was introduced in 2014. We have avoided over €1bn in costs, by improving water and energy efficiency in our factories, and using less material and producing less waste. The USLP has also become a decisive factor to attract the best talent; and has been instrumental to forging strong partnerships with NGOs, government organisations and other businesses.
“But the USLP journey has also presented hurdles along the way. Unilever has many programmes to improve livelihoods and to enhance opportunities for women; but measuring their actual impact has proved extremely difficult. Likewise, the complexity of many of the global supply chains that we source from has made our sustainable procurement targets extra challenging,” added Marmot.
Following on from the USLP, Unilever is committed to continuing to be a sustainable leader and has developed a new, fully integrated corporate strategy: the Unilever Compass.
The Unilever Compass is based on three core beliefs: that brands with purpose grow, companies with purpose last, and people with purpose thrive. Supporting our three beliefs, the Unilever Compass lays out 15 multi-year priorities that cover the full spectrum of Unilever’s business and wider ecosystem. Each priority will have ambitious targets, with corresponding programmes and projects. They will tackle key challenges such as packaging and waste, gender equality, human rights, and fair value – as well as climate change and social inclusion. The Compass is underpinned by the same rigour as the USLP, and will be more holistic, inclusive, and far-reaching than ever before. More details will be unveiled in due course.
Alan Jope concluded, “The USLP is drawing to a close after 10 years but the journey towards achieving our purpose of making sustainable living commonplace certainly isn’t. In fact, as the world is changing increasingly quickly, our employees, our consumers, our customers, our suppliers, our partners expect more from us. We know that we can continue to lead the charge, but we need to be better, bolder, and faster."

text Roy Horne, Head of Climate Action in Unilever’s Ice Cream business group. 
Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps the company will take to reduce emissions to zero within our own operations by 2030 and to net zero across our value chain by 2039.
As we’re halfway through Climate Week NYC, Roy Horne, Head of Climate Action in our Ice Cream business group, explains why the frozen food industry needs to take action to reduce its carbon footprint, and explains how warming up the cold chain will be a key part of the process.
How did you start working on climate change and ice cream?
Well, I've been at Unilever forever, nearly 40 years, but I have been working in the area of climate action for a couple of years. I was drawn into it because one of my responsibilities in my previous role was for the business’s refrigeration systems. I started to appreciate and understand the high carbon footprint that comes with frozen refrigeration, and to look into the issue of how we might be able to address it.
So how is ice cream linked to climate change?
We have a saying – it’s about cows and cabinets. These are the big focus areas for us. Dairy ingredients naturally come with a relatively high carbon footprint, and our refrigeration systems – in particular the electricity used by our 3 million or so sales freezers – also contribute a lot to our footprint.
What are we doing to reduce the impact of our refrigeration systems?
The cold chain is everything involved from the ice cream being churned in our factories, right the way through to the point you or I take it out of the cabinet or out of our home freezer. All the way through it needs to be maintained at an average temperature of -20°C. So that involves refrigerated storage – it means refrigerated trucks, it means refrigerated sales cabinets, it means home freezers. It’s the whole process that requires refrigeration.
Now, since the dawn of the ice cream industry, maybe 120 years ago, ice cream has been stored at around -18°C and a few years ago, some of the R&D team began challenging that and saying why is that the target temperature? Why not colder or why not warmer?
And that led us to investigate – can you change the design temperature of ice cream and still give the consumer exactly the same experience? And broadly we think the answer is yes, you can. We think we can change the design temperature from -18 to -12°C or even higher and still give exactly the same consumer experience. And that difference in temperature will translate to something like a 20–30% energy saving in the cold chain.
And that won’t lead to melted Magnums and soggy Cornettos?
No. It involves changing the formulation of the ice cream, so that you would get exactly the same experience with an ice cream in your left hand at -12° as the one in your right hand at -18°C. You would not be able to tell the difference. Already, many of our products have a lower design temperature. We have a small pilot in Germany just concluding at the moment and we have a larger pilot starting shortly in Indonesia, where we’re going to be doing this at scale.
What about the cows?
We should talk about cows as they’re equally important. Cows are lovely, of course. They produce milk and cream, which are great to use as raw materials in ice cream, but they come with a high carbon footprint attached. So, we are having a deep conversation in our brands now, about where we need to use dairy ingredients and how we can improve the carbon footprint of those ingredients.
Ben & Jerry’s are the first of our brands to move on that and they have a programme that’s focused on working with farmers to bring down the carbon footprint of dairy products. And it is doable. It takes quite a lot of changes to the agricultural practices on a farm, but it can be done, and they have pilots in both Europe and the US where they are working with farms to make it happen. So, improving dairy is clearly going to be important for us.
The other thing we can do is remove dairy and replace it with plant-based ingredients. In ice cream, it’s relatively easy to replace the dairy fat with a tropical oil, like coconut oil, and as a consumer you wouldn’t notice the difference. And we already have some really good vegan and non-dairy products on the market – if you’ve never tried a Magnum Vegan, you need to go and try one.
It’s an area where we’ll only get better, replacing traditional dairy ingredients with plant-based ingredients, which have an inherently much lower carbon footprint than dairy – it can be around 70% lower for many of them.
So we need to put all of this together. We have to make the refrigeration changes, improve the dairy footprint and up the amount of plant-based ingredients we’re using, and then we have to bring that all together in all our brands. Because if we can do that, we will bring down our carbon footprint significantly.
Why is it so important for us to take action on our carbon?
Well, you know, there are a number of ways of looking at this. The simplest way I think is, it’s the right thing to do and good businesses do the right things. We are a good business and we do want to do the right thing.
But we also will find over time, with climate change never out of the news for long, that our consumers and the big retail customers, will start to ask us “what are you doing to bring down your carbon footprint?” – remember, our carbon footprint is their carbon footprint. They actually only have control of a very small part of what makes up their footprint, because most of it is from the products they’re buying in from companies like ourselves.
And the food industry plays a surprisingly big role in the carbon footprint of everyone on the planet, and in particular in developed markets. Around 20–30% of our carbon footprint comes from the food that we consume, and that’s a mix of carbon produced during the agricultural production of the food and also processing, packaging and distribution. Action by the food industry is really important.
Are we working with others in the field to address the issue of climate?
We would love to work with the whole of the ice cream industry. When we announced we were working on this programme to warm up our cold chain, we invited other partners in the ice cream industry to join us. And we are really hoping that others will come and join in, because it makes good sense for the planet and it makes good sense for the future of the industry.
Looking at the scale of the problem, do you feel hopeful for the future?
These are quite radical ideas, and they take time to develop and embed in the industry. But the good thing, I think, is that when we’ve looked at our carbon footprint in the ice cream industry, and taking the ideas we’ve already got and are testing – if we add them all up, we can see something like a potential 70% reduction in greenhouse gases. That makes me very hopeful, because it shows we’ve already got a good bank of ideas, which could have a very big impact on our greenhouse gas footprint.
However, they’re all hard work. None of these come with just small changes. They require big changes. And climate scientists say to limit global warming to about 1.5°C, the food industry (and indeed many other industries) needs to bring its carbon footprint down by something like 80–90% over the next 30 years. So there is a huge amount to be done, and we are always open to new and additional ideas.
But that’s why I love my job – it’s great to be working on the early phase of a big change programme. It’s exciting to gather in these ideas and to test them out and then be able to pass them on to our brands and country teams and see the change that’s possible. So yes, I am hopeful that we can make a difference.
text The trend towards healthier products and lifestyles has been gathering pace for some time; and next to mindfulness, exercise and eating well, people are increasingly turning to vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) to take a more holistic approach to their wellbeing.
Improving people’s health, confidence and wellbeing through brands that are powered by purpose and innovation has always been a priority for Unilever. And as part of our Compass strategy, we have identified Health & Wellbeing as a key growth space of the future. We spoke to Jostein Solheim – CEO, Health & Wellbeing – to find out more about it.
What does the Health & Wellbeing landscape look like?
The category has gone through a fundamental shift, moving from a problem/solution industry dominated by pharmaceutical companies to one offering proactive solutions for immunity and mental, physical and emotional health.
There are four main trends driving category growth. The first is consumers who are shaping the category – digitally minded Millennials and Gen Zers who no longer see health as the absence of illness and disease but as a lifestyle goal to pursue. The second is that products are becoming more about benefit-led personalisation rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The third is the overlapping of what once used to be separate categories: VMS, beauty, personal care and foods. And lastly, the rise of the conscious consumer and the rapid shift to digital is really encouraging a sense of community and lifestyle.
How big is this business for Unilever?
This is a huge opportunity. Turnover for Health & Wellbeing is already more than €1 billion, with over 50% USG each year since 2019. And since 40% of the business is online, we can drive economies of scale in our digitally focused marketing model and expand each brand’s in-store presence – a real strength of Unilever’s.
With the global market estimated to be worth more than €160 billion, our focus is on the US, China and Europe – geographies where the industry is sizable and growing. Vitamins and dietary supplements, which constitute about two-thirds of the market, and functional hydration fit best with our strategy.
With our portfolio of insurgent brands, our focus is on market development and playing in high-growth benefit spaces that are ripe for disruption.
What brands are in our portfolio?
We have a range of fast-growing, science-driven brands that are reinventing the industry.
Liquid I.V. is a functional hydration brand that has disrupted the market and is the No.1 powdered hydration brand in the US.
OLLY, the No. 1 Gummy Vitamin brand in the US, makes vitamins and supplements that deliver ‘real deal’ benefits. The brainchild of Eric Ryan, OLLY is on a mission to make taking good care of yourself ‘truly delightful’.
SmartyPants Vitamins is a leader in the industry when it comes to transparency around science and ingredients and is the No.1 multivitamins brand and No.1 gummies brand on Amazon. SmartyPants Vitamins has provided life-changing nutrients to over 27 million women and children around the world via its ten-year partnership with the Vitamin Angels charity.
Onnit, best known for its Alpha Brain product, is the No.2 nootropics/brain supplements brand in the US. Onnit supplements help optimise the human body and are built on the best nutrients and scientifically proven ingredients.
Nutrafol is the No.1 dermatologist-recommended hair growth brand in the US and offers a range of clinically tested, physician-formulated products designed to help thinning hair and hair health for women and men at various stages in their lives.
Equilibra, an Italian company founded in 1987, has always been dedicated to people who want to take care of their wellbeing and beauty in a natural way, combining quality and innovation.
Welly is bringing happiness and ease to healing with their disruption in the first aid category. Their recent expansion with over-the-counter Welly medicine and dietary supplements includes the categories Pain & Fever, Cough & Cold, Digestive, Sleep, Allergy, and Mood.
What was the thinking behind our acquisition of Nutrafol?
Nutrafol strengthens our portfolio in a new benefit space for us, while playing at the high-growth intersection of VMS, beauty and hair, which is where our expertise can really add value. Unlike traditional hair growth products that focus on a single cause, Nutrafol takes a whole-body approach that uses medical-grade nutraceutical ingredients to target the multiple root causes of hair loss and hair problems, including hormones, stress, lifestyle, metabolism, nutrition and ageing.
Unilever’s topical hair science capability and Nutrafol’s credentials in hair wellness from within are a great combination.
When buying VMS products, what do people look for?
Not only is science important; being transparent is also critical for consumers. Nutrafol, for example, has clinical studies to prove efficacy, and transparency is at the heart of SmartyPants.
We know people want purpose-driven brands and that is at the core of our offering. For example, Liquid I.V.’s give-back programme has donated 25 million servings of hydrating products and OLLY supports mental wellness in schools through the JED Foundation, a US non-profit organisation.
And finally, social proof and endorsement. People are online, researching and looking for evidence on the science, reviews, recommendations and expert opinions. The power of being a digitally led brand is the power to educate in a complex category. ONNIT is a great example with its Instagram tribe nearing a million followers.
What does the future hold?
It is expected that most category growth will be driven by gummies and powders, which is 80% of our current US business.
In the next few years, we want Health & Wellbeing to make an even more material contribution to Unilever’s overall business through organic growth in the US, international expansion in China and Europe, and new M&A opportunities.
We see a continued focus on benefit-led spaces, such as sleep and stress, functional hydration, beauty from within, kids’ health and nootropics. All of which we are uniquely placed to do well in.

text “Did you know Unilever is not only one of the biggest ice cream companies in the world, we’re also one of the biggest retailers in the world?” asks Berty Jacob, an R&D cold chain specialist at Unilever’s Colworth site in the UK.
It’s a claim he makes only half in jest because Unilever owns, freely loans and maintains 3 million ice cream freezers around the world. “And wherever the freezer is located in a shop or supermarket, we have a retail space,” he says.
Ice creams and the freezers they are kept in are big business for Unilever. Analysts predict that the global market in impulse ice cream will grow 5.7% between 2023–2028 and many of these sales will be made from Wall’s ice cream cabinets in convenience stores.
Bestway, a wholesale retailer that serves more than 12 million consumers through its stores in the UK, Pakistan and the Middle East, says 34% of total ice cream unit sales are impulse purchases. And while good weather is the biggest reason for purchasing an ice cream, being visible to the consumer was a very close second.
Maximising merchandising
“Consumers need to see our freezers when they go in-store, open the lid and enjoy browsing and picking up an ice cream. You need to make your freezer experience really great,” Berty says.
So, as well as providing retailers with a free loan of the ice cream freezer, Unilever’s customer development team use the DAVE acronym to ensure each freezer showcases – Desirability, Availability, Visibility and Execution.
The team works with retailers to refine their ice cream assortment and provide a planogram to show what quantities of stock goes where. “It’s critical to have a good mix of your best-performing products and new products during peak season,” explains Out-of-Home Programme Manager, Ebru Ozdemir, “having the right visibility at the point of sale can increase sales by more than 25%,” she adds.
Cutting energy use through innovation and sustainability
To keep the ice creams in perfect condition, freezer cabinets need to operate at -18°C. And that takes energy.
“Emissions from retail ice cream freezers account for 10% of Unilever’s value chain greenhouse gas footprint,” acknowledges Berty.
But since 2008, all of Unilever’s freezers have been run on natural refrigerants. It was a pioneering move that saw much of the industry follow suit, “and that has made our fleet of freezers 30% more energy efficient,” he says.
Value engineering that creates energy efficiencies at this final part of the cold chain is an ever-changing and innovative space.
In Germany, for example, Unilever’s R&D team have run a successful pilot that has changed the design temperature of ice cream from -18 to -12°C. This gives ice cream lovers exactly the same consumer experience and means freezer cabinets can run at -12°C too. It’s a difference that translates to something like a 20–30% energy saving.
Berty’s team is also exploring the use of renewables and has developed the first ice solar-powered mobile cabinet which has been tested.
“There is still work to do, the cost of solar panels is high, and the storage batteries add significant load to mobile cabinets, but the concept is worth pursuing,” he adds, “so watch this space.”
Using AI to make sure you never run out of stock…
While Bestway reports that 50% of its impulse ice cream sales are made outside the summer months, there is no doubt that good weather during this four-month period in the northern hemisphere has a positive impact on sales.
For retailers, maximising that seasonality means working to ensure they never run out of stock.
“Research tells us the majority of consumers choose what ice cream they want to buy at the cabinet,” says Berty. “People don’t pre-plan. It’s not like buying milk; they won’t come back tomorrow. If you don’t have the product, you’ve lost the sale.”
Making sure retailers don’t run out of stock has seen Unilever incorporate digital tools and AI into the freezer fleet. “Today, 50,000 freezers are AI-enabled when it comes to putting the right product in the right freezer,” adds Sarosh Hussain, Head of Digital Selling Systems, “and there are plans for more.”
“The camera fitted inside our cabinet takes a photo periodically, sends it into the cloud and it’s analysed using AI to let shopkeepers know what to restock and submit orders in a frictionless way,” Berty explains.
Some stores have seen an uplift in sales of 15–35%. And while it’s early days, there is potential for stock data to be used for market research, to shape targeted promotions and further help retailers understand what their customers want.
… and to take vending machines to the next level
The image capture and AI that enables smart cabinet freezers are also being utilised by the team to take a slice of the multibillion-euro vending machine market which is servicing the likes of airports, petrol stations and university campuses.
Wall’s smart freezer vending machines open at the tap of a consumer’s contactless payment of choice, they can pick up and even amend their order, and the AI will capture and charge them for what they’ve bought.
Research tells us the majority of consumers choose what ice cream they want to buy at the cabinet. People don’t pre-plan. It’s not like buying milk; they won’t come back tomorrow. If you don’t have the product, you’ve lost the sale.
Berty Jacob
Smart cooling solutions to help with power outages
But not all countries that love ice cream have consistent power supplies. In India and South Africa, load shedding can see power cuts for three to six hours, and in-store freezers and mobile freezer carts that bring ice cream to rural communities need to keep their stock at a temperature so it doesn’t spoil.
Here, the team have created a smart lining in the freezers which holds water at a depressed freezing point of -21°C, much like an insulating block you’d use in a cool bag.
When the freezer’s compressor runs, the liquid lining freezes at this temperature. When the power goes out, the lining uses the energy that the ice water gives off as it changes state. This chemistry can keep frozen stock at the right temperature for up to nine hours.
Staying curious and on the lookout for the next cool innovation
Scientists are curious by nature; with Berty and his team, you also get the sense that offering value and driving sales for his retail users are at the heart of his quest for new innovations.
“Wherever the science takes us next,” says Berty, “we’ll work to ensure our freezers maximise energy efficiency, employ digital and AI tools to futureproof our retailers, and continue to enhance their consumers’ experience of our ice creams into the future.”
And you can’t get cooler than that.

text Stella Constantatos, Senior Manager in the Business Operations Sustainability team at Unilever 
Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps the company will take to achieve net zero across our value chain by 2039. As Climate Week NYC draws to a close, Stella Constantatos, Senior Manager in the Business Operations Sustainability team at Unilever, talks about why it’s critically important for us to look outside our own walls and engage our suppliers on climate.
How did you start working on sustainability and climate change?
I joined Unilever at a Home Care factory in South Africa in a process engineering role, producing soap powder more than 20 years ago. After a while, I wanted to work on something that had a positive impact on the environment. Through stints in manufacturing and logistics, supply chain and procurement, with 15 of my 20 or so years focused on sustainability, I developed a good grounding for the role I’m in now.
What does your current role involve?
I lead the work on our upstream emissions. Just over 60% of our total greenhouse gas footprint arises upstream of our operations, which covers all the raw materials and packaging – grown, extracted or refined, and processed – that arrive at our factory gates.
My day-to-day job is a mix of internal and external interfaces. There’s a lot we need to do internally with our procurement organisation. For example, we’re looking at how we can leverage our buying power to drive impact when we buy a chemical or a commodity. There’s also a big external part, which I love, dealing with our suppliers directly. At the moment, we’re in the middle of a pilot of the Unilever Climate Programme, working with over 30 of our suppliers – a small but important subset of the 54,000 suppliers we buy materials and services from. We’re figuring out ways to improve transparency of climate impact and ultimately reduce emissions from our shared value chain.
Why is it so important to help suppliers reduce their emissions?
Unilever has been acting in this space for a couple of decades, and we believe it’s absolutely relevant for our consumers and other stakeholders and for the longevity of our business.
We’ve seen disruption to our value chain in the past due to extreme weather events, and this is only going to worsen with climate change if we – and other companies and parts of society – don’t move fast enough. We need to tackle emissions in our supply chain to ensure the future security of supply. And we have to do this by working with others, because we won't be able to achieve our goals on our own.
We’re not directly in control of what suppliers do – we can only influence them. So, we’ve spent quite a bit of time looking into the materials and the services that Unilever buys, to identify the most important ones for us to focus on. That’s how we’ve arrived at a target of 300 suppliers we want to work with to accelerate their climate journey. These suppliers effectively cover 60% of our upstream emissions.
What are we asking our suppliers to do?
Three things. One is to set a climate target in line with what the science says is needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees – namely, to halve emissions by 2030. We’re also asking them to publicly report on their progress for accountability. And the third, and probably most important thing, is that they share the carbon footprint of the materials they sell to us.
Being able to understand the source of emissions and look at the scenarios to reduce them and then work out the trajectory over time is very powerful. We believe that when you know the footprint of the material you are producing as a supplier, then you can dig into where your biggest source of emissions is, and you know where you need to act.
What are we doing to support our suppliers?
The suppliers currently working with us in our pilot are a very diverse group, covering different sectors of the economy and ranging from small, privately owned enterprises through to very large corporations, bigger than ours in some cases, and they are scattered all over the world.
They are also all at different stages of their climate journey. Some are really advanced and we can learn a lot from them. Then, at the other end of the scale, we have suppliers who have not started acting on climate yet. And this is a real challenge, because we’ve had to adapt our engagement approach depending on what stage these suppliers are at. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t cut it.
For those just starting out, we’ve partnered with some great organisations to provide access to free online materials so suppliers can effectively fast-track their climate learning. Then we’ve given the next group up access to a platform that helps them calculate a footprint for the materials they sell to us, and we’ve commissioned independent consultants to help them develop the numbers. We’re funding the work, but the suppliers will own their data.
The third group of suppliers already know their product footprints, and so they’re testing a new data exchange mechanism intended to standardise the receipt of this data into our business. We need all our suppliers to share information in the same way – for example, without excluding methane emissions. Once this has been established, we’ll identify how we can best make use of the data for mutual benefit.
What has been the biggest learning so far?
I’ve been positively surprised that our pilot suppliers are much more advanced in their journey than we could see from desktop research. Having conversations rather than reading reports has been extremely informative.
We’re also learning to look at each business individually. If we’re buying skimmed milk powder from a host of different suppliers around the world, we know that the contexts are different. In some cases, it will be a smallholder farmer with three or four cows per farm. In other cases, it might be a couple of hundred cows with a high degree of automation and we know these factors influence the product footprint.
So absolute comparisons are risky because they don't show that level of context. It’s more important to know the trajectory of numbers. If they start at, for example, eight kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of skimmed milk powder, then we need to know how that figure is coming down over time. That’s the conversation we want to have.
What do you see as the biggest contribution Unilever can make?
I think we offer a deep insight into what drives consumption and consumer behaviour, combined with an understanding of the sources of emissions and climate impact of choices. This helps to build the business case for our suppliers and makes us a credible partner.
What do you think has been the biggest shift in Unilever’s climate strategy?
When I was recruited to join Unilever in South Africa, I asked, “OK, what kind of environmental strategy and programmes do you have as a business?” And they put a one-page environmental policy in front of me that was largely compliance-based. Since then, I’ve seen the evolution of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which brought sustainability to the forefront of the business, to our current Compass strategy, which integrates sustainability and business into one single strategy. It’s been a massive transformation and it’s fascinating and amazing to have been part of that.
Given the scale of the challenge that lies ahead, do you feel hopeful for the future?
I feel very motivated to work in this space, but I do it with a healthy dose of realism and pragmatism. I’m not blindly optimistic because I think we have to be realists to know what we’re dealing with so we can tackle it face on.
All the people I work with are absolutely committed to tackling this challenge – my colleagues in the Business Operations Sustainability team, our extremely smart R&D colleagues, our expert Science team and highly professional procurement organisation. And when you mobilise thousands of people in one direction, there’s massive potential to have an impact – both across our own business, and influencing other companies to follow.
text In Côte d'Ivoire, we’re helping smallholder cocoa farmers formalise the rights to their land through an affordable land tenure documentation process. The West African country is where we source much of this key ingredient for our ice creams.
Having legal ownership of their land or long-term rights as tenants benefits the farmers by helping to improve their livelihoods and give them more security of the land they depend on. It benefits the environment as farmers have an incentive to invest in the land by adopting sustainable agriculture practices. And it benefits our business because we have a more sustainable source of high-quality cocoa.
This work is being carried out by the Côte d’Ivoire Land Partnership (CLAP), which brings together Unilever and other brands and industry bodies, the Ivorian and German governments, and Meridia – a social venture that manages the implementation of the programme on the ground.
Through a pilot that’s running in two villages in the south of the country, CLAP members subsidise the cost of the documentation and provide technical support to help the farmers navigate the certification process.
Earlier this year, the first group of farmers – more than 40% of whom are women – received 130 land tenure documents. CLAP’s early scale project, which runs until next year, aims to cover 30 villages and deliver over 9,000 documents. It will also create a blueprint for a larger-scale project.
Why is CLAP so important?
With poor land management, soil degrades over time. This means that the farmer’s productivity and therefore their income decreases. It also means they are more likely to expand into forested areas to try and make up the shortfall.
With security of tenure, they have more choice of what, when and how to grow. Importantly, they also have an incentive to invest in the land and plan for the future, adopting long-term, sustainable practices. This increases the yield they get from the land, which in turn helps prevent deforestation.
As land tenure impacts cocoa farmers from a social, economic and environmental perspective, it’s a complex challenge that requires collaboration between many stakeholders including government, local NGOs, international development agencies and the private sector.
Cocoa farming is central to the Côte d'Ivoire economy. According to the World Bank, it accounts for 10–15% of GDP, nearly 40% of export earnings and provides a living for 5 to 6 million people, or one-fifth of the population. So it’s essential that the sector is sustainable for the long term.
“At Unilever, we believe that when smallholder farmers thrive, so will the environment – and our business. That’s why we’re encouraged by the progress that’s being made through CLAP in helping smallholder cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire secure legal land rights,” says Megan Willis, Unilever’s Head of Sustainable Sourcing, Naturals. “When smallholders have legal or recognised rights to their land, they are in a stronger position to improve the lives of their families and communities, secure land legality for future generations, and protect the forests and environment.
This programme is a great example of how Unilever collaborates with industry, civil society, communities and governments to drive impactful and systemic change for people and planet.
Megan Willis, Unilever’s Head of Sustainable Sourcing, Naturals
The CLAP partnership
The Côte d’Ivoire Land Partnership (CLAP) was founded by The Hershey Company, Barry Callebaut Group, The Cocoa Horizons Foundation, Unilever, the German Cooperation (implemented by GIZ GmbH) and the German Cocoa and Chocolate Foundation. All those involved are keen to work on the multiple issues related to insecure land tenure faced by Ivorian cocoa farmers. CLAP is endorsed by the Côte d’Ivoire government’s Rural Land Agency (AFOR) and managed on the ground by Meridia.

text Until now the chemistry that provides the cleaning power of many laundry and detergent products has relied on ingredients derived from fossil fuels, also known as black carbon.
But a new range of renewable and biodegradable products from Spanish chemicals company Cepsa Química is helping to transition these carbon-intensive ingredients to circular chemistry.
This surfactant is known as NextLab linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and is made using green carbon derived from biomass. It’s renewable and biodegradable, and it provides the same properties and cleaning performance as LAB created from black carbon.
And in a potentially ground-breaking move for circular chemistry, Unilever is the first company to buy NextLab LAB and use it in our production.
What we’ll use LAB for
Unilever will use NextLab LAB to make linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), the world’s largest-volume synthetic surfactant and our most-used surfactant by volume too. It’s a key raw material used in many of our brands, including Persil, Cif and Sunlight.
That’s because surfactants are a vital ingredient in cleaning products. They work as ‘surface active agents’ to ‘stir up’ activity on the surface you’re cleaning, whether that’s a mark on a jumper or grease on a plate. Their activity breaks up stains and suspends the ‘dirt’ in water so that it can then be easily removed in the wash.
Currently, all LAS surfactant is made from black carbon from fossil fuels. Using LAB (which is created from renewable biomass to make LAS) is a more sustainable way to produce this key raw material. And that’s not all. In Unilever’s Home Care business, 46% of our cleaning products’ carbon footprint comes from the chemicals used to make them, so using chemicals derived from renewable feedstocks will reduce their carbon impact too.
Fuelling the transition to circular chemistry at scale
Achieving circular chemistry requires a period of transition and a phased approach to renewable and recycled feedstocks. As it stands, 85% of carbon demand in the chemical and derived materials sector is still met by black carbon from fossil sources. To create the change to more sustainable sources requires greater demand for it.
This means that Cepsa Química is using a ‘Mass Balance’ process to create NextLab LAB, which sees traditional black carbon sources blended and co-processed with sustainable green sources and tracked to ensure an appropriate volume of green carbon in the LAS produced. In other words, mass balance allows material from fossil fuels and from green or recycled sources to be mixed while the amount form each source is monitored.
“We are determined to accompany our customers in their progress towards the development of products that are increasingly more environmentally friendly,” says Cepsa Química Head of Chemicals Paloma Alonso.
Manufacturing surfactants in this way is not only the most viable short-term alternative to purely fossil-carbon derived products, it’s also a vital stepping stone in the shift from petrochemical to renewable feedstocks.
Using a mass balance approach allows us to start transitioning from black carbon sources to renewable alternatives that offer the same quality cleaning that our consumers expect and love in our brands
Unilever’s Head of Procurement, Home Care, Kirsten Tosin.
“We are delighted to be the first buyers of NextLab and hope fellow suppliers and industry players will follow suit in exploring more sustainable and affordable alternatives as we work together to transform the industry from being heavily reliant on fossil-fuels to using renewable and recycled sources instead."
text Sun, wind, water, green hydrogen and biomass are all sources of clean, sustainable energy, more commonly referred to as renewables.
When combined with smart technologies, these naturally regenerating sources have the potential to create more energy than the world needs and, unlike energy derived from fossil fuels, they significantly reduce emissions and last for generations to come.
In 2015, as one of the first members of global energy initiative RE100, we committed as a business to sourcing 100% renewable electricity for our operations. We also set a target to reach 100% renewable energy (all electricity and heat) by 2030.
Today, 86% of all the electricity we use globally is from renewable sources – covering what we buy from the grid in the markets where we operate and what we also generate ourselves. Over a third of our thermal energy (heat) is from renewables too.
This is delivering multiple benefits. It’s making our business more resilient to rising energy costs and has been the biggest driver in reducing our operational emissions by 64% since 2015.
Change is not without its challenges
When you are a global business consuming energy at 245 sites in more than 70 countries, ensuring that all your electricity and heat is from renewables does not come without challenges.
Not all countries or even states within countries offer the same access to renewable electricity. And while new technologies such as heat pumps and concentrated solar power have the potential to provide up to half our thermal energy needs, many are not yet commercially viable or widely available.
So we’re taking action, by working to increase our access to renewable electricity supplies and supporting innovations in thermal energy, such as piloting the use of hydrogen technology.
And we’re doing so not just to drive towards our own 2030 target but to reduce market barriers to global uptake.
Five ways we’re moving forward with clean energy solutions
Purchasing from local renewables suppliers 
We want to support renewable energy generation in the areas in which we operate and so where we can, we source renewable electricity from local markets. This takes the form of contracts called power purchase agreements (PPAs) and green electricity tariffs. “We favour suppliers with solid strategies to increase their renewable electricity supply base and recently built assets, such as wind farms, that are directly increasing local capacity,” explains Andrea Rickert-Pulvermann, who leads our renewable electricity approach.
Where we can’t do this, we buy openly traded certificates linked to renewable electricity generation called renewable energy certificates (RECs), to match our grid power demand.
Increasing self-generation and storage on site
To improve and secure access to renewable electricity, we are also generating some of our own supplies on-site.
We have added capacity from solar installations through third-party suppliers and our own investments at over 40 locations in 18 countries, such as at the pictured site in South Africa. Many installations cover 10–30% of a site’s annual electricity demand.
This makes business sense. In India, for example, we estimate that solar installations at six of our factories across four different states will generate savings in the region of €4.9 million over 15 years.
And there are plans for battery storage devices too, allowing us to expand our installations, store electricity during the day and use it at night in our manufacturing.
Piloting new solutions to drive efficiencies
We need heat to produce most of our products, to cool them before packing. An example here would be ice cream. Until now, this low-grade heat has been released via cooling towers because it is of no use in other manufacturing processes.
This is changing, thanks to our group engineer for thermal energy, Vivek Nesarikar. He and his team have been piloting the use of heat pumps which capture low-temperature, low-grade heat and increase it to 65–80⁰C, which is the normal operating temperature for most of our factory processes.
This means heat that used to be wasted can be used again and again. “It is a clean technology solution in the truest sense,” says Vivek. In Unilever Hindustan, utility executive Kothiya Jaydeep (pictured) and his team are using heat pumps to heat water, thus eliminating diesel use in hot water generators. And in our ice cream factories, such as our site in Cikarang in Indonesia, heat pumps can potentially offset heat requirements and reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 70%.
Setting principles to source biofuels sustainably
While it’s our priority to replace the natural gas boilers in our factories with low-carbon technologies such as heat pumps, biofuels from biological materials such as agricultural waste and organic municipal waste can also help supply our thermal energy. But our aim is to limit their use and ensure the biofuels we use don’t lead to further deforestation and provide clear greenhouse gas savings across the entire lifecycle.
We have defined a set of principles (PDF 110.51 KB) that see us use biofuels sustainably. Unilever primarily uses them as a transition fuel for thermal energy. In exceptional cases, we may use biofuels in combined heat and power (CHP) plants where electricity grid supplies are not stable, or their carbon intensity is lower than that of the local grid.
We are also working to source local supplies, not use materials if they can be put to a more circular use and ensure our use of biofuels will not distort local food prices. In Sri Lanka where tea is one of the country’s most popular beverages, we put spent tea leaves to good use as biomass, powering our factories in Horana and Agarapathana.
Using our influence for good
Accelerating the world’s transition to clean energy cannot be achieved in silo. For Unilever, this means making choices that activate broader changes.
We’re asking our suppliers to help us decarbonise our shared value chain, and providing tools and resources to those with the biggest climate impact to help them measure and reduce their emissions.
Our engagement with utilities in the US to demand renewable energy supplies resulted in one of the most coal-reliant of energy providers developing its Renewable Solution Program. This helped to bring clean energy to Missouri.
And we’re keeping up pressure on governments. As one of the first members of RE100, we’re helping to signal demand for renewable electricity globally. And as a principal partner at the COP26 global climate conference, we signed up to US State Department’s Clean Energy Demand Initiative, to encourage countries to support corporate renewable procurement.
“Renewable energy will remain high on our agenda for COP27,” says Rebecca Marmot, our Chief Sustainability Officer. “It will take businesses, governments and all parts of society to accelerate action to tackle climate change – and Unilever is as committed as ever.”

Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps the company will take to reduce emissions to zero within our own operations by 2030 and to net zero across our value chain by 2039.
To coincide with Climate Week NYC, Lewis Rae, Unilever’s Safety, Health, and Environment Capabilities Manager for Air Emissions, explains why decarbonising our factories is such a vital part of meeting our climate targets.
How did you start working on climate change at Unilever?
During my final year of University, I began an internship at our Port Sunlight factory in the UK. I'm an engineer and I really enjoyed getting to apply my university learning to do something positive for the environment. We were doing a lot of energy efficiency projects in the factory, and I began to see just how big the potential is to reduce emissions within a company like Unilever; the scale of the issue blew me away and I wanted to make an impact.
Why is it important that Unilever reduces operational emissions?
Emissions from our factories, offices, and labs only account for about 2% of Unilever’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint, but it’s where we have direct control. Unilever acting to reduce its own emissions gives us credibility and a platform to influence our suppliers and partners around the world, and it allows us to advocate for greater change and faster action. There are also billions of consumers around the world who use our products, and they are expecting us to do the right thing – we’re seeing this reflected in buying behaviours.
If Unilever didn’t do anything, how would climate change impact the business?
It’s already affecting us, and we’re now investing in measures to adapt to climate change impacts. For example, our whole value chain relies on water – from farms to factories right through to consumer use – and increasing water insecurity poses a risk to our business. We've already seen the challenges this creates in some of our factories around the world, and that’s why we’re rolling out water stewardship programmes in the worst affected areas. At the same time, we’re seeing climate change impacts affecting our raw material supply and that’s why we’ve launched our regenerative agriculture programme.
What progress has Unilever made so far?
Our target is to reduce our operational emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline. So far, we've reduced those emissions by 64% and we’re well on track to meet our interim goal of 70% by 2025, but there's a lot still to do. We’ve already made good progress with implementing some of the more straightforward projects, so now we have to invest in newer and more complex technologies like heat pumps and electrifying our thermal systems. It's a big engineering challenge to get to that 2030 goal.
What kind of actions are being taken in Unilever factories?
We’ve pledged to source 100% renewable electricity and all the grid electricity used by our factories is now from renewable sources. We’re also transitioning our thermal energy which is the energy we use to generate heat for our production processes and for heating our factories. We can do that by using sustainable biofuels or by converting our thermal systems to use renewable electricity instead of combustion.
Along the way, we also need to focus on energy efficiency because the most sustainable energy is the energy that we don't use at all. We need to optimise our factories as much as possible to reduce our reliance on energy in the first place. Doing so makes sense for our business – we estimate that since 2008, energy efficiency has saved Unilever well over €1 billion, helping to protect us from the energy price hikes we see today.
How do you go about increasing energy efficiency?
There's a lot that we can do. Low-efficiency electrical equipment such as older motors in our factories can be upgraded to more efficient versions. There are also process optimisations, such as heat recovery - if we have a waste heat stream that's no longer a high-enough temperature to be useful, we can use heat pumps to bring that heat back up to a higher temperature, reducing our demand on fossil fuels or renewable energy sources.
Historically, factories were not designed to use heat as efficiently as possible. Now, companies such as ours are taking on this challenge.
How do you manage emissions across such a diverse mix of operations?
We're a highly motivated ‘team of teams’ with engineers, sustainability professionals, and procurement specialists. It's a collaborative effort between all those functions and more. We use data to help us prioritise action at our highest emitting sites, but with such a diverse mix of products our factories are all very different; you would likely need to use different solutions for an ice cream factory in the US than for a laundry powder factory in Brazil. The challenge is that we're working on large-scale complex systems. We need to make sure we're building up our technical capabilities in the right areas.
What emerging technologies have a role to play?
We expect things like hydrogen, thermal energy storage, and carbon capture to play a part in the future, but there are no silver bullets. We are experimenting in these areas to test proof of concept. Earlier this year there was a demonstration at our Port Sunlight factory to use hydrogen as a fuel in our industrial boiler, and we successfully proved that hydrogen can safely be used in manufacturing operations to generate steam. When made with renewable electricity or reforming natural gas with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen can be a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.
How is Unilever considering the wider impacts of decarbonisation?
One important example is that we are very careful to only use truly sustainable biofuels. The carbon accounting rules that are followed by most companies today allow you to call any biofuel ‘renewable’, meaning it has zero net emissions. Although plant-matter absorbs carbon dioxide when growing, biofuels still release it when combusted, and they might not come from a truly renewable and sustainable source. So, when we been implementing these projects, we follow our own strict criteria to ensure a responsible approach.
How is Unilever encouraging its factories to get on board with climate action?
The passion that we get from employees when we launch a sustainability project speaks volumes. People see what's going on in the world and want to make a difference, and arguably the biggest impact individual employees can make is within Unilever. Personally, I'm proud of the fact that I’ve directly contributed to emissions reductions at Unilever that are far greater than the emissions that I’ll create in my lifetime as an individual.
Given the scale of the challenge, do you feel hopeful for the future?
Decarbonisation is a big challenge but none of it is impossible. Everyone has a job to do and if everyone plays their part then then we will get there. The ideas are out there, and the solutions exist today. It's just about acting on them and implementing them, quickly.
And it’s vital that we share our success stories and our challenges, because the more people talk about the actions that we’re taking on sustainability, the more we'll learn collectively and be able to make a difference.

A Day at Work
A Day at Work in the New Normal – Ensuring Employee Safety in Office Spaces
text This week saw leaders from business, government and the climate community, in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly and the City of New York, come together to drive climate action. Fast.
Because the numbers are clear. Climate change is costing the earth.
This year, Pakistan experienced flash floods that saw lives lost and millions of homes ruined while Europe faced its worst drought in 500 years. Natural disasters like these, exacerbated by climate change, cost the world $210 billion in 2020, a financial outlay that not only impacts communities but also the economies, businesses and infrastructure that serve them.
Climate risk impacts financial risk
Mitigating risks like these is one of the most cited financial reasons for investing in climate action. Money spent on equipment, emergency logistics, damaged products and lost sales is clearly visible on corporate balance sheets.
But the business case for investing in sustainability should not just focus on risk but also opportunity.
“Increasingly, companies are changing their business models to embed sustainability in their corporate strategy,” says Chief Supply Chain and Business Operations Officer, Reginaldo Ecclissato. But while 86% of organisations have a sustainability strategy in place, only 35% have acted on that strategy.
Unilever is one of them.
And we’re making sure that commitment is loud and clear to our consumers and the investment community.
The business case for decarbonising our business
We believe in a business model that can serve shareholders and stakeholders simultaneously. That can be a growth engine providing economic opportunity and climate justice. As a global company, it is impossible for us to do our fiduciary duty without considering climate change, destruction of nature and social inequality.
In 2021, we unveiled our Climate Transition Action Plan setting ourselves the goal of reducing our greenhouse emissions to zero by 2030, and those across our value chain to net zero by 2039.
“We were the first company in the world to put our decarbonisation plan to a shareholder vote,” CEO Alan Jope told a business audience in New York. It was supported by 99.6% of our investors.
“Stating that we have a climate emergency is becoming an unpopular thing to do,” Jope adds. “We will not back down on this agenda.”
Across our operations, we’re working with suppliers at local and state level to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Our Future Foods commitments are working to transform global food systems and reduce the impact of waste. Home Care’s Clean Future initiatives are replacing 100% of black carbon from fossil fuels with a carbon rainbow of renewable or recycled alternatives, while our Beauty and Personal Care brands are helping improve health and wellbeing through Positive Beauty.
As well as decarbonising our product portfolio, we’re investing €1 billion in our Climate &Nature Fund to help combat climate change over the next ten years and we’ve lent our support to the COP26 call for $100 billion/yearto support developing countries to take action on climate issues.
While all these investments are driven by a business looking to do good, they are also initiatives that are good for our business.
Attracting consumers through brands that commit to climate
In an IBM survey of 16,000 consumers in ten major economies, 51% said that environmental stability is more important to them than it was a year ago, and 49% paid a premium for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible.
“By sourcing sustainable ingredients and using recycled and recyclable packaging, we’re making it easy for consumers to choose the brands they already trust, knowing that they don’t cause harm,” says Chet Henderson, VP, Consumer Insights team.
And that strategy is bringing results.
Today, our 13 billion dollar brands shaped by sustainability and purpose account for more than 50% of our group turnover. In the first half of this year, they also delivered 9.4% underlying growth.
Winning the war on talent
And it’s not just consumers who seek out sustainability from companies. One in three people who changed jobs last year accepted a role with an employer they consider to be environmentally sustainable, and 34% took a role where they could directly influence environmentally sustainable outcomes.
As the graduate employer of choice in more than 50 companies, we recognise our climate credentials are a key part of winning the war on talent. And with BCG research showing that companies who attract high-calibre candidates achieve 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.1 times the average profit margin, we look forward to seeing how these future leaders can impact our bottom line.
Investment will determine the quality of our future lives
But while we can share our story and commitment to climate investment – it’s one story. The world needs more businesses to act sustainably and more investors to back them, and wider multilateral goals to succeed in keeping temperatures below -1.5°C.
“There’s a $3 trillion spread between what we’re doing and what needs to happen,” Tom Steyer, co-founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, told investors and financiers at Climate Week.
That means investors and financiers need to “invest and underwrite with intent,” says Jason Storah, CEO of Aviva Canada, a member of the UN Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, and that capital is mobilised to find low carbon solutions.
Investment communities are taking note.
Larry Fink’s investment company Blackrock has the ear of Wall Street and beyond thanks to the $10 trillion it manages. In his annual letter to CEOs, he was clear: “Stakeholder capitalism is not woke, it is capitalism.”
And momentum is gathering. Fiona Reynolds is CEO of Principles for Responsible Investment, a Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance created between her company and the UN’s Environment Programme Finance Initiative.
It can cite members from 50 of the world's largest asset owners that have more than $7 trillion in assets under management.
That weight of capital is now being directed towards making a climate difference, with the Alliance committing to transitioning their investment portfolios by 2050. They have also set targets for 2025.
Governments are beginning to act too, with New Zealand one of the few countries to have enshrined its 2050 net zero emissions target in law. It has allocated NZ$4.5 billion to a Climate Emergency Response Fund in its 2022 budget, alongside its pre-budget commitment of NZ$2.9 billion to the Emissions Reduction Plan.
So the direction of travel is clear.
But more of the investment community need to mobilise their funds for climate. As Reynolds says, “investing as usual isn’t going to cut it.”
We no longer have the luxury of time. “Established systems have their own inertia, and even if a better future is possible,” says Thomas Lingard, Unilever’s Global Climate and Environment Director, “it won’t happen unless enough people and organisations stand up to show how it can be done, to advocate both for the business action that is necessary, and the changes to the policy frameworks that would enable it.”
Choices need to be made to rebuild the world in a healthy way. If investors and financiers pull together with governments, NGOs and sustainable business, we can get things done.

text It’s clear from our second quarter and first half-year results – which we announced on 26 July – that our strategic choices are paying off. Here’s how we’re making progress against each one.
Win with our brands as a force for good
This is about growing our brands by delivering functionally superior products, as well as taking action on social and environmental issues that our consumers care about: improving the health of the planet, improving people’s health and wellbeing, and contributing to a fairer, more socially inclusive world.
Our big brands are in good health, with the 13 brands in our €1 billion+ club growing in aggregate at 10% in Q2, underpinned by bigger, better innovation, a relentless focus on functional product superiority, and continued brand investment. Our €1 billion+ brands now make up over 50% of our turnover.
Rexona, Omo, Magnum and Hellmann’s – also four of our most purposeful brands – were among those which posted the strongest growth. Our challenge now is to commercialise the incredible work we are doing on sustainability even more extensively across our brands.
Develop our portfolio into high-growth spaces
We’re successfully evolving our portfolio into higher-growth spaces, with double-digit growth in H1 from both our Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing businesses.
Prestige Beauty delivered second quarter growth of 14%, helped by the launch of Tatcha in the UK, the return of consumers to offline channels and the expansion of some of our Prestige brands in China.
Health & Wellbeing delivered 28% growth, with another particularly strong quarter for Liquid IV. We announced the acquisition of Nutrafol, the No.1 dermatologist-recommended hair growth brand in the US, underpinned by extremely robust clinical evidence. Sales are almost entirely online, with the largest proportion direct-to-consumer.
We also completed the disposal of ekaterra on 1 July for €4.5 billion – the culmination of a huge amount of work to establish the world’s largest pure play tea business.
Accelerate our growth in US, India, China and key growth markets
We performed well in the US and India, growing at 8.7% and 19.5% respectively. Growth in the US continues to benefit from our portfolio changes, with Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing both contributing strongly. Growth in India is driven by strong competitiveness and a portfolio that has been built with brands competing up and down the price tiers.
In China, our third priority market, our growth declined by 9.3% as a result of the country being in a strict Covid-19 lockdown. That said, our competitiveness remains strong and we began to see some easing of the restrictions in June.
In addition, we saw good performances from our other key growth markets like Vietnam, Turkey and Argentina. In Turkey, as consumers adapt to the reality of extremely high inflation, we’re adjusting our portfolio to offer the right product formats and pack sizes, and strengthen our position in the right channels. Not surprisingly, we see good growth, for example, in the discounter channel.
Vietnam tells a different story. The economy and consumer confidence are both relatively strong and we’re seeing a continued shift to multi-channel shopping and premium propositions such as Pond’s Age Miracle.
Lead in the channels of the future
Our focus on leading in the channels of the future saw our e-commerce business grow 25% in the first half of this year. In just over five years, e-commerce has grown from 2% of our turnover to 14%.
We continue to invest significant resources in channel expertise, technology and channel-specific innovation. For example, in recent months we launched Dove premium hair treatment masks and the Clear scalp care range, aimed to meet the needs of the younger male consumer, in China, and Lifebuoy bundles in the UK. All designed to achieve high transaction value.
Build a purpose-led, future-fit organisation and growth culture
Perhaps the most important progress this year has been the launch of our new Compass Organisation on 1 July. The objective is to make Unilever simpler, faster and more agile, more focused in our categories, and with greater empowerment and accountability.
It is a simple model with five Business Groups, a lean Corporate Centre, and a low-cost, technology-driven transactional backbone, Unilever Business Operations.
The new Business Groups are now in place and are fully responsible for their portfolios – from strategy to monthly performance – and Unilever Business Operations is now responsible for all of our transactional processes which benefit from Unilever’s scale.
As our CEO Alan Jope says: “This major change to Unilever’s operating model is an important further step that will underpin the delivery of consistent growth, which remains our first priority.”

text Pakistan 22 October 2016 – Unilever’s health soap Lifebuoy celebrated the 9th Global Handwashing Day (GHD) together with famous celebrity, Fahad Mustafa, and other influential people in attendance. This record breaking event was the biggest GHD event in Pakistan, with 20,000 participants.
Lifebuoy broke the Guinness World Record of Most Number of Double High-Fives in relay in 60 seconds and created history. Through this initiative, Lifebuoy will give back to society by saving many precious lives, as each high five will lead to teaching 5 kids the act of handwashing. Lifebuoy aims to save more and more lives this way under the ‘help a child reach 5’ platform.
The event, hosted by Lifebuoy, saw various recreational activities for the people with food stalls and entertainment for kids. Fahad Mustafa was accompanied with Adnan Siddiqui, Anoushey Ashraf, Saira Kabeer and Yasir Hussain. Together they taught the people the correct way of washing hands and took the Lifebuoy pledge to save lives.
Each year, more than two million children don’t reach their fifth birthday due to diarrhoea and pneumonia. Many of these deaths are easily preventable through simple practices like handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce preventable diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia – the main causes of child mortality. Millions of parents across the world do not have the same privilege often because of a simple lack of hygiene awareness. Handwashing with soap is a simple action, but one that can make a big difference. Join us in helping spread the
Global Handwashing Day is an annual awareness day celebrated in over 100 countries worldwide. Unilever through its Lifebuoy brand co-founded Global Handwashing Day in 2008. To celebrate, Lifebuoy called out to the nation to high five for a life. One high five has the power to save 5 lives as Lifebuoy will be teaching the children of Pakistan the act of handwashing.
Brand commitment – GHD 2016
Lifebuoy runs the world’s largest hygiene behaviour change programme and has already reached over 337 million people across the globe since 2010. As part of Lifebuoy’s commitment to decreasing child mortality and to the Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan, Lifebuoy is aiming to change the handwashing behaviour of one billion people by 2020.
This year Lifebuoy aimed to organize the biggest GHD event ever. It was the biggest CSR Campaign Pakistan has ever seen with over 20,000 people gathered at PAF Museum Karachi on 22nd October for the betterment of the nation.
Unilever Sustainable Living Plan
Unilever believes that through brands like Lifebuoy, it can help and inspire billions of consumers to take small everyday actions like handwashing with soap, that can add up to a big difference for the world. Unilever has set out to help more than a billion people take action to improve their health and well-being by 2020 through key actions like Lifebuoy’s handwashing (behaviour change) programmes.
About Lifebuoy
As the world’s leading health soap, Lifebuoy aims to make a difference by creating accessible hygiene products (soap) and promoting healthy hygiene habits. With this in mind, Lifebuoy aims to change the hand washing behaviour of one billion people by 2020. Since 2010 Lifebuoy has changed the hand washing behaviours of 257 million people across 24 countries.

text Our skin provides a formidable frontline defence system, a waterproof barrier that insulates us and helps to protect against bacteria, pollutants and damaging sunlight. However, problems like dryness, sensitivity and itchiness can quickly develop if our skin’s barrier is compromised.
The natural oils or lipids, like ceramides, that make up 50% of our skin’s composition are essential in ensuring that the skin’s barrier remains strong. Ceramides act as the mortar that binds our skin cells together and are incredibly effective at counteracting dryness. Unsurprisingly, these molecules have become a hero ingredient in a host of products ranging from body washes to facial moisturisers.
This is an amazing time to be a microbiologist; advances in technology, bioinformatics and, increasingly, in AI, are unlocking new knowledge about the human microbiome every day
Michael Hoptroff, Senior Microbiome Research Manager at Unilever R&D
Building stronger skin from within
Many products which contain ceramides claim they will replace and replenish the naturally occurring ceramides that have been lost due to ageing, environmental factors, or the use of harsh cleansers. However, the large size of these ceramides prevents them from penetrating the skin and getting to where they are needed most.
Unilever scientists have been looking to overcome this issue by finding ways to trigger the skin’s natural ceramide-producing processes, thereby enabling it to heal from within. “Our products contain skin-identical lipid precursors which act as the building blocks to allow the natural process of ceramide production to occur,” says Dr Andrew Mayes, Senior Skin Research Manager at Unilever R&D. “They provide the raw materials and then the skin can do the rest.”
“Through our research, we have not only discovered how the skin can be stimulated to maintain its own production of ceramides, but also that this production leads to a direct improvement in skin quality and hydration,” he continues.
This discovery, recently published in the scientific journal Nature Scientific Reports, shows that boosting ceramides can lead to dramatic improvements for people with dry skin. “We can now build stronger skin from within,” says Dr Mayes. “By strengthening and rebuilding the skin’s functional moisture barrier, skin feels better, looks better, and is more resilient to the outside world.”
Harnessing the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence
Knowing that this ceramide technology could help the skin rebuild itself, our Unilever scientists turned their attention to a new question: Could this also help the skin microbiome, the naturally occurring community of microorganisms that live on the skin?
Thanks to Unilever’s long-standing strategic partnership with Eagle Genomics, the world experts in Artificial Intelligence-powered microbiome data analysis, we identified that when people used our products, they showed a significant increase of Staphylococcus epidermidis: a bacteria associated with good skin health.
This special microbe is naturally present on human skin and plays a key role in the production of beneficial metabolites, including lactic acid, that help defend the skin against external threats.
“The ability of product application to improve the skin microbiome was a very exciting discovery,” said Dr Barry Murphy, Senior Microbiome Research Manager at Unilever R&D. “Over the past number of years, we have built a strategic partnership with Eagle Genomics. Using its AI-augmented platform to analyse complex biological data and study how our skin and its microbiome interact, has been central to this research.”
Thanks to another method developed by Unilever scientists in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Science and published in mSystems, we also identified that following the application of the product, the skin microbiome was also more connected and resilient than at baseline.
Growing a new sector in personal care
But what does this mean for the consumer? “This improvement in skin barrier composition and in the skin microbiome, will help improve skin condition and provide long-lasting skin protection for those using our products,” says Dr Murphy. 
Already present in some of our skincare ranges, such as Vaseline Total Moisture and Dove Deeply Nourishing Body Wash, this new technology could soon lead to more targeted innovations across several brands. New scalp, oral and underarm care products, for example, could be added to the growing number of microbiome personal care products already on the market.
40 timesbigger than five years ago, the microbiome personal care sector is growing fast (2016–2021, GNPD data)
At 40 times bigger than it was five years ago (2016–2021, GNPD data), the microbiome personal care sector is clearly growing fast. As one of the first to enter the sector, Unilever has established itself as a leader in the field: working with more than 15,000 microbiome samples and registering more than 100 microbiome patents over the last decade. Unilever now owns one of the largest proprietary skin microbiome databases in the world.
“This is an amazing time to be a microbiologist; advances in technology, bioinformatics and, increasingly, in AI, are unlocking new knowledge about the human microbiome every day,” says Michael Hoptroff, Senior Microbiome Research Manager at Unilever R&D. “This research has the potential to unlock the future of beauty and wellbeing and allow us to create a new generation of products underpinned by the best data and scientific knowledge in the world.”

text Imagine if all young people growing up around the world entered the workplace with the right skills. The potential for their personal development – and global progress – would be unlimited.
From raising productivity and reducing inequality to creating businesses and improving communities, there’s no end to the benefits their talents and ideas could bring.
The right to an education is enshrined in Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Through education, young people can acquire the skills they need in order to actively engage with opportunities and truly fulfil their potential.
Extraordinary challenges
However, young people today face extraordinary economic, social and cultural challenges and need a wide variety of skills to thrive in work and life, including basic literacy and numeracy, digital and interpersonal skills.
According to a new report (Opens in a pop-up window ) by the Education Commission and UNICEF, three-quarters of young people aged between 15 and 24 are off-track to gain the skills needed for employment. Furthermore, one in three young women are not learning, training or working.
Supporting Generation Unlimited
One way Unilever is helping to address these challenges is through a collaboration with UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited (Opens in a pop-up window ), a global multi-sector partnership created to meet the urgent need for expanded education, training and employment opportunities for young people on an unprecedented scale.

Empowering volunteers
Our Dirt is Good brand is helping Generation Unlimited expand the Global Volunteering Initiative (Opens in a pop-up window ), which currently empowers 12.5 million volunteers in 40 countries to be a force for good within their communities.
Our partnership aims to help over 1 million young people in India and Brazil to take action and build the valuable and transferable soft skills that they will need to thrive in a complex and uncertain world.
Equipping 10 million young people with the essential skills needed for work opportunities by 2030
As part of Unilever’s Compass priorities and commitment to youth skills development, we have committed to helping 10 million young people aged between 15 and 24 years to gain the employment skills that will help them find meaningful work opportunities and prepare for the future of work. Our work with Generation Unlimited is one of the many ways we are working to achieve this aim.
Empowering girls through education
Unilever and Generation Unlimited are also partners in the UK government’s innovative Girls’ Education Skills Partnership, joining forces to boost access to education and employment for girls in developing countries. With funding from the partnership, Generation Unlimited will help expand the Passport to Earning digital skills platform that provides girls with free certified education and skills training, and links them to future employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. It will also support the Challenge Fund that aims to equip girls with the skills they need to pursue a career in STEM.
As Rebecca Marmot, Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Youth unemployment is a global challenge that has been compounded by Covid-19 related disruption. By harnessing their desire for purposeful action and matching it with skills training and know-how, Unilever and Generation Unlimited can empower young people to become dynamic leaders and entrepreneurs who promote equality and positive change in their communities and the world.”

text Unilever’s Chief Digital and Commercial Officer Conny Braams 
Conny, what’s front of mind for you at the moment when it comes to the digital world?
The ongoing digitisation of people’s lives, or ‘E-everything’ as we call it. Digital is changing how consumers live, discover, learn, play and shop and how customers plan, promote, sell and deliver. These changes in consumer and customer behaviour are why digital is transforming so many industries with impact and at speed.
In the past, consumer purchasing habits were mostly influenced by mass media and on-shelf availability. Today, we have a multitude of digital channels, platforms and devices, providing more choice than ever. Hyper- and supermarkets, bricks-and-mortar stores and physical mom & pop stores will remain very relevant in the years to come while at the same time omni- and pure-play digital commerce channels will continue to grow fast.
We’re seeing commerce channels such as Amazon become media channels where we build brands, while media and entertainment channels such as Instagram become commerce channels where we sell our brands. This convergence of media, entertainment and commerce is blurring the lines between marketing and sales. It’s leading to new business models, new ways to build brands and convert to sales. So the consumer is changing. The customer is changing. Shopping is changing.
Entertainment is changing. Marketing is changing. Sales is changing and Unilever is changing too. Change, of course, brings opportunity. There are great opportunities ahead, and with that comes great responsibility.
Web3 must be thoughtfully designed with the highest principles of ethics, transparency and choice. Because the internet without trust is scandal. 
What are some of the greatest opportunities ahead – and the responsibilities involved?
A big change will be the next iteration of the internet, Web3, which brings new behaviours and new economies. In the US alone, it’s set to grow to an $8 trillion market, powered by streaming, gaming and shopping platforms. And business investment is predicted to reach $800 billion by 2024. What an exciting new space for our brands. It’s a realm where real-world limits don’t apply but real-world representation absolutely must.
As we begin to create and invest in the next environment where people spend their time and their money, we need to be clear – among all the hype – on what we are building and what we need to do to make sure people don’t have an experience riddled with scams.
Today, we have a window of opportunity to act. We’re just scratching the surface with how we can use Web3 to transact, share data and put people back in control. The adoption curve of Web3 today has been compared to where we were in 1998 with Web2. To put it into context, the founders of the future companies for Web3 are girls in Year 5 today.
And while we don’t know what questions and unintended consequences will arise as Web3 forms, we are starting from a position of foresight – with a backlog of issues still to solve in Web2.
A true technology evolution must be accompanied by the development of substantial ethical infrastructures and policies. If safety isn’t coded in early on, it will be much harder to secure down the line. Web3 must be thoughtfully designed with the highest principles of ethics, transparency and choice. Because the internet without trust is scandal.
How is Unilever taking responsibility in the digital ecosystem?
Back in 2018, noting that we needed to create a safer, more trusted digital environment for society, people and our brands, we announced Unilever’s Responsibility Framework. It covers three areas:
Responsible Platforms: committing to not invest in platforms that do not protect our children or that create division in society.
Responsible Content: committing to tackling stereotypes through Unilever’s initiative #Unstereotype and championing this across the industry with UN Women’s #Unstereotype Alliance.
Responsible Infrastructure: committing to partner with organisations who are working to develop a better digital infrastructure.
To create a truly safe and trusted environment online, advertisers must recognise the ethical and social dimensions of a borderless digital world. We must unite around common standards for creating shared, immersive worlds including interoperability to allow freedom of movement and freedom of goods across virtual worlds.
The currency in Web3 is not crypto. The currency is trust.
What do you think we need to make a safe Web3 happen?
I think there are four key elements.
We need regulators and governments to create the space for innovation and learning alongside clear boundaries and enforcement of accountability.
Advertisers need to invest responsibly in partners, content and infrastructure.
Tech must be designed with ethics, inclusion and safety coded in from the offset and rapid innovation to address the energy consumption required to mint tokens and coins.
People must co-create and build trust together online.
Because the currency in Web3 is not crypto, the currency is trust.
How is Unilever preparing for Web3?
Over the past years, our marketers at Unilever have been experimenting with many brands. Take gaming, the epicentre of community, culture and commerce. One of our premium beauty brands, Tatcha, created Tatcha Land in Animal Crossing to launch its new rice wash product, and our Sunsilk brand has introduced a metaverse city in the virtual world of Roblox, packed with games to inspire and educate girl gamers.
Meanwhile Rexona hosted the first marathon in the metaverse, offering users a chance to customise their avatar with adaptive wearables such as wheelchairs and running blades. And Closeup has used the power of the Web3 to create a place in Decentraland where people can express their love for one another virtually by getting married in the metaverse.
We’re experimenting with recruitment too. Our Pot Noodle Brand created an augmented reality careers fair for students, as a replacement of its live event which was cancelled due to Covid 19. This virtual experience led up to 400% more attendees than previous in-person events, and a 5x increase in job applications.
These examples signal there is a commercial opportunity ahead. Web3 will bring booms and busts and lots of experimentation, just as we saw in the late 90s with Web2. This time, with hindsight and foresight, we should put people first: creating experiences where people feel safe, valued and included and back in control of their own data – with proof of ownership, control of how that data is used and how it’s monetised. We have a window to act, to avoid the need to react. Because in the end, it’s people, not technology that will measure the success of our efforts.

text Unilever is partnering with San Diego-based biotechnology specialists Geno (Opens in a pop-up window ) to jointly invest $120 million (€114 million) in a new venture to commercialise plant-based alternatives to feedstocks like palm oil and fossil fuels that are used to make cleansers for home care, beauty and personal care products.
The venture has huge potential to help power our growth and strengthen our supply chains by creating cost-competitive alternatives and reducing our dependence on a small number of feedstocks that can have high levels of volatility. Geno is already starting to scale up the process for its advanced technology to produce the exclusive ingredient.
Effective, sustainable, resilient
So how does it work? Using cutting-edge biotechnology, Geno has established a fermentation process that uses sugar to convert microorganisms into an ingredient needed to make key cleaning agents called surfactants. These are integral to all cleansing products – across the home, personal care and beauty industries – to help them foam, lather, and lift dirt.
We’ve committed to ensuring a deforestation-free supply chain for palm oil by 2023.
While offering incredibly effective cleansing properties, these ingredients are predominately made using fossil fuels and palm oil with few viable substitutes that can be manufactured at scale. That’s why this initiative could be a game-changer for the combined $625 billion (€594 billion) home, beauty and personal care markets. Better yet, initial estimates have shown it could reduce the carbon footprint of palm-derived ingredients by up to 50%. 
As one of the world’s biggest soap and detergent manufacturers, we’re excited to be part of this innovation at an early stage, which marks our biggest collaboration in biotechnology alternatives to palm oil to date. Further strategic investors are expected to join in time.
Marrying science and nature
While palm oil will remain an important feedstock to Unilever, alternative ingredients can play a growing role in diversifying supply chains to offer greater choice alongside sustainability, cost efficiencies and transparency.
This new venture will sit right at the intersection of science and sustainability.
Richard Slater, Unilever Chief R&D Officer
“Biotechnology has the potential to revolutionise the sourcing of our cleansing ingredients and ensure Unilever is a future-fit business – for consumers, shareholders and the planet we all share,” explains Unilever Chief Research & Development Officer Richard Slater.
“This new venture will sit right at the intersection of science and sustainability, meaning we can continue to grow our business without relying on palm oil or fossil fuel derivatives, while making our supply chains more resilient from having access to alternative ingredients. 
Sourcing a diverse range of feedstocks to power our formulations is key to supporting current and future growth.
Peter ter Kulve, President, Unilever Home Care
“We will be marrying science and nature to make sure there is no trade-off for our consumers between the efficacy and sustainability of their products. We are building this innovative new venture to have the scale to drive real impact and change in our industry, helping to reinvent the chemistry of home and personal care products for the 21st century,” he adds.
“The best supply chains balance resilience and cost effectiveness,” agrees Peter ter Kulve, President of Unilever’s Home Care division.
“A business like ours is highly reliant on a few commodities, such as oil, therefore sourcing a diverse range of feedstocks to power our formulations is key to supporting current and future growth. The power of biotechnology to aid this is something we are particularly excited about. Working together with Geno, we look forward to scaling the next generation of ingredients that do not increase the use of fossil fuels or add further pressure on land use.”
Acting on the climate crisis
Creating new bio-based materials will help us make the planet positive personal care products of the future.
Fabian Garcia, President, Unilever Personal Care
“We’ve developed technology in response to our planet’s urgent climate crisis and have proven that biotechnology can replace traditional methods to produce ingredients with bio-based sources that deliver both high performance and sustainability,” says Christophe Schilling, CEO of Geno.
“Creating new bio-based materials will help us make the planet positive personal care products of the future,” adds Fabian Garcia, President of Unilever Personal Care.
“Collaborating with scientific partners is essential to accelerating our progress, bringing to market cutting-edge, cost effective and sustainable solutions that our business and consumers will benefit from.”
text In 2019, the World Economic Forum calculated that by the end of 2020, there would be 40 times more bytes of data in existence than there are stars in the observable universe.
At Unilever, we have teams of analysts working hard to process the dizzying amounts of data we receive from our consumers each day. Our aim is to understand their wants and needs better, so we can provide the best products and services possible.
But we know that data analysis presents enormous opportunities beyond consumer insights. That is why Unilever’s CMI People Data Centre (PDC) created the Data for Good team. The team allows our analysts space to spend 10% of their working week using their skills and knowledge to give something back to the wider world.
Information is powerful
Since its creation, the Data for Good team has worked on a wide range of projects and the results highlight the many ways data analysis can make a practical difference to our everyday lives.
Christi Kobierecka, the global Social Business Analytics team lead for Home Care was one of the people who helped set up the Data for Good team.
"I still remember when I had the very first conversation about doing more to support societal issues,” she says. “It was about four years ago. A group of like-minded individuals had gathered and started discussing ways of supporting social causes in the PDC.
“Because what we do is amazing – we have access to a wide variety of datasets that we use to analyse consumer behaviour. So why not use these capabilities to unlock insights that can help communities and improve the wellbeing of people both inside and outside Unilever? As a result, we put together a small group of passionate individuals to work on the idea and Data for Good was born.”
Creating inclusivity and supporting wellbeing
Internally, we have been using data to try to ensure that, as a business, we are as inclusive and ethical as possible. For example, we wanted to identify any potential barriers faced by employees with disabilities at Unilever, so the team did deep dives on social media and internal surveys as well as examining external reports and case studies.
They looked at examples of best practice around disability inclusion and used the analysis to create insights and recommendations to help us become a disability-confident company. The team also used research and analysis to support our Unmute campaign, helping to shape our domestic violence policy.
Two of our key external projects focused on supporting better mental health. We worked with Place2Be, a children’s mental health charity, to monitor social media and provide insights on their biggest campaign of the year, to help them better understand and target their key audiences in the future.
We also collaborated on an NHS trial of Talk it Out, a free app that gives people a safe space to work through their thoughts and feelings using guided exercises. Our insights showed beyond doubt that users felt significantly happier and less anxious during the trial, which helped to move the project from pilot to launch.
The people behind the numbers
Social media gives us access to the largest focus group in the world and allows us to gather valuable insights. Analysing information drawn from social media platforms and internet channels, known as social listening, has been a key part of many of the projects.
Polina Dolgacheva is a Social Business Analyst working for the People Data Centre in Russia. Polina joined the Data for Good team to work on a project following the launch of our Unmute campaign on International Women’s Day in 2021.She saw the impact that social listening can have, in terms of providing a better understanding of the people behind the data.
“I think it’s amazing that from all these different numbers and letters and words and data points we can create this very clear picture that gives us so much information,” says Polina.
“When you work with search data or social media, it’s as if you talk to people face to face. It’s not just a statistic anymore, so it touches you on a much deeper and more personal level. That made us so much more motivated to do the best we can and provide the best, most granular insights we can, just because real people’s lives could be affected by this,” she adds.
Bringing focus to the bigger picture
We have used social insights externally too, to help highlight where charities might focus their efforts, to ensure they have the greatest possible impact.
In Asia, we helped to pinpoint the barriers female farmers face in growing their smallholdings. We’ve also run upskilling workshops for refugee entrepreneurs, teaching them how to become data experts themselves, so they can use social and search analytics to build their own businesses.
And the feedback we’ve had from our partners has been overwhelmingly positive. Ross Faulkner, Partner at Talk it Out, explains that having rigorous insights provided by the Data for Good team has helped them to grow their future plans and ambitions for the wellbeing and productivity app.
“To be able to use the insights as soundbites when we’re talking to people about why they should try the app, it’s such a brilliant short cut for us to be able to say, look, this is why this app is powerful to use and here is the data to show you. Not only do the numbers speak for themselves, they are also grounded in robust data,” says Ross.
“Those little nuggets and insights are the most powerful things, but to get to them takes so much work. That is what the Data for Good team did for us. They did such a brilliant job of getting us those really well-articulated insights.”
Get involved
We’re always looking for new projects to collaborate on, big or small, so if you have something in mind that you would like to discuss with us, we’d love to hear from you.
“The beauty of our team is that we not only have a wealth of expertise from conducting market research in new ways but also a global footprint and the power of all the different minds that come with that,” says Deepa Patel, Data for Good lead.
“The team has the passion, determination and creativity to uncover valuable insights in every project and we can’t wait to put all of this together to help make a difference on even more projects in future.”
If you’d like to work with our Data for Good team, please send us a message telling us who you are and how we can help
text We have committed to a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023
Many of our Hellmann’s and Knorr products are made with one of the world’s most commonly used edible oils – soybean oil. Now we’re strengthening a sustainable partnership with a key soybean supplier to ensure the soybean oil we use at one of our major factories in Brazil will only ever be sourced from deforestation-free or non-converted land areas.
Our factory in Brazil’s Pouso Alegre region is collaborating with supplier CJ Selecta in a move that delivers on the terms of our stringent People and Nature Policy – a set of principles which uphold our commitments to protecting natural ecosystems, respecting human rights, supply chain transparency, and more.
The tighter supply conditions will extend traceability and transparency requirements that are already in place for direct suppliers to CJ Selecta’s factory in Araguari, so that the same governance applies to indirect suppliers too.
It marks a significant step forward for our sustainable soybean supply chain ambitions, which include a commitment to being deforestation-free by 2023, and to achieve 100% sustainable sourcing of our key agricultural crops.
Scaling positive impact
“We are very proud of this strengthened partnership and shared ambition with our trusted partner CJ Selecta,” says Marcelo Scarcelli, Unilever’s Head of Procurement, Naturals & Nutrition, who signed the agreement along with CJ Selecta CEO Guilherme Tancredi, CJ Group President Jerry Chun, and Commercial Manager Rodrigo Ribeiro.
“This initiative has the potential to scale positive impact within soy supply chains, bringing more of CJ Selecta’s indirect suppliers into the transition to sustainable soy. It also demonstrates the continuous efforts of Unilever and its brands to build sustainable solutions to help the planet while delivering options for consumers who are increasingly concerned and aware about the origin of ingredients they are bringing into their homes,” he explains.
CJ Selecta's factory in Araguari, Brazil 
CJ Selecta CEO Guilherme Tancredi adds: “CJ Selecta believes that commitment and responsibility go hand in hand with the sustainable development of agriculture in Brazil. One of our main goals is to generate a positive impact by integrating this supply chain from the farm to the final client. This programme in partnership with Unilever should become a benchmark to the market and a milestone of our new environmental, social and governance products.”
Restoring and regenerating nature
Eliminating deforestation and conversion is not only an essential natural solution to the climate crisis, it can also help address social inequity. Encouraging improved farming practices can help boost the yields – and therefore incomes – of smallholder farmers and their families, which reduces pressure on forests.
We are contributing to the development of international standards which recognise farmers and suppliers for their efforts to address the big issues associated with soy production, such as vegetation loss in Brazil’s Cerrado. And we are founding members of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS). Since 2010, the development of the RTRS standard has enabled farmers to improve their practices and gain accreditation.
We continue to work with farmers, NGOs, our suppliers, other agri-businesses and governments to support sustainable farming practices that improve soil health, water quality and yields by using regenerative agriculture methods, such as planting cover crops.
“At Hellmann’s, we pride ourselves on superior products and pioneering sustainability practices,” says Christina Bauer-Plank, Global VP of Hellmann’s & Dressings.
“I’m delighted that this move brings both those important elements together in a change that’s better both for people and for the planet.”
CJ Selecta is a Brazilian producer of SPC (Soy Protein Concentrate), soybean oil, lecithin and ethanol, among other products. It is part of the CJ Bio Division, under the Korean CheilJedand Group.

text Unilever International has entered into a global partnership with IHG Hotels & Resorts to replace bathroom miniatures with bulk amenities in over 4,000 of its properties, to help the hotel group cut its single-use plastics.
The term ‘bulk amenities’ is defined as larger bottles or dispensers of at least 235ml in size, which are not replaced after each guest stay.
As part of this partnership, we will supply a range of full-size Dove products – hand wash, body wash, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion – to IHG Essentials and Suites Collection hotels across the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia and Greater China. These include Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Avid hotels, Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites, and account for around 80% of IHG's portfolio. Dove will be supplying various sizes of packs and all 500ml bottles will be refillable.
The switch to full-size formats is expected to save at least 850 tonnes of plastic annually in IHG's Americas region alone and represents a significant reduction in the group’s overall plastic footprint.
“Unilever is committed to making sustainable living commonplace, and we have ambitious targets across every part of our business,” comments Umesh Shah, CEO of Unilever International. “We are pleased to partner with IHG Hotels & Resorts to help extend sustainable living into the travel industry by providing bathrooms with bulk amenities. Through this collaboration, IHG’s guests will enjoy a range of products from Dove during their stay, while reducing their use of plastic.”
The roll-out follows the recent launch of larger-size bathroom amenities into InterContinental Hotels & Resorts properties. In 2019, IHG became the first global hotel company to commit to all its hotel brands removing bathroom miniatures in favour of larger-size amenities, a key step in its pledge to eliminate single-use items throughout the guest stay by 2030.
As Yasmin Diamond, Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs, IHG Hotels & Resorts, says: “IHG has pioneered the move to minimal waste in the hospitality industry and we’re excited to spell the end of bathroom miniatures through our collaboration with Unilever. Our guests are increasingly mindful of the impact their travel choices have on the environment and our colleagues, investors, owners and suppliers all expect us to act responsibly.”
It’s about giving consumers more sustainable choices
Unilever’s 2025 plans to help create a circular economy for plastic include commitments to halve the amount of virgin plastic we use in our packaging and achieve an absolute reduction of more than 100,000 tonnes; collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell; ensure 100% of our plastic packaging is designed to be reusable, recyclable or compostable; and to use 25% recycled plastic in our packaging.
Our vision is a world in which everyone works together to ensure that plastic stays in the economy and out of the environment. To achieve this, we need to partner with like-minded organisations who share the same goal of reducing plastic and giving consumers more sustainable choices.
Our partnership with IHG Hotels & Resorts is a great example of how we’re joining forces with the travel and tourism sector to reduce the incidence of single-use plastic when people travel.

text The co-founder of an innovative project which connects communities in Pakistan with quality healthcare by creating opportunities for female doctors to rejoin the workforce has won our annual Young Entrepreneurs competition.
Empowering female doctors to serve communities
As one of three founders of the doctHERs project, Dr Sara Saeed is creating a network of clinics in Pakistan where people with limited or non-existent access to primary and secondary healthcare can now have consultations with qualified doctors. The project’s key innovation is using technology to draw on the large number of qualified female doctors who currently do not practise, largely because of socio-cultural barriers.
“The majority of people in Pakistan live in rural areas and many have no access to qualified medical services,” explained Dr Saeed following the awards. “But there are many, many trained female doctors in Pakistan, of whom for cultural reasons only around 30% remain in practice.
“Our insight was this – why not link these doctors to patients through technology, particularly through video consultation and the use of mobile apps?”
Aiming to reach 1.2 million patients by 2020
Dr Saeed, from Karachi, is a qualified general practitioner. When she became pregnant with her daughter and was unable to continue radiology training, she began working with a micro-health insurance business – and says she was struck by the fact that although at least 50% of medical students in Pakistan are women, many do not work after becoming mothers.
“I realised that a lot of women doctors simply don’t get the opportunity to do the work they have trained for,” she said. Since its launch, she added, doctHERs has received large numbers of applications from female doctors. That allows doctHERs to assess doctors against strict eligibility criteria before assigning them to a specific clinic, where they will be one of a small team that patients can get to know.
“Each of our clinics is therefore a one-stop shop for primary and secondary healthcare, staffed by a nurse, with a pharmacy and collection laboratory as well as a telescreen for consultations,” Dr Saeed said. The fourth clinic opened by doctHERS specialised in mental health and was described by Dr Saeed as a “very successful pilot in an area that is very under-resourced in Pakistan”.
So far, doctHERs has directly impacted 15,000 lives through clinical services and reached 100,000 people through community outreach. It now employs 15 doctors, five nurses and five specialists, and aims to reach 1.2 million people by 2020 by expanding its nurse-assisted video consultation programme to more than 500 clinics. Fees for patients begin at $1 (€0.9) and are limited to a maximum of $5 (€4.4) for each consultation.
Supporting entrepreneurs to create a brighter future
Dr Saeed was one of seven finalists of the Unilever Sustainable Living Young Entrepreneurs Awards, run in partnership with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) and in collaboration with Ashoka.
This year, 927 young entrepreneurs from 99 countries applied for the awards, which celebrate and support people under the age of 35 who are working on a unique product, service or application that will help create a brighter future.
The seven finalists received a total of more than €200,000 in financial support, and mentoring from Unilever and the CISL.
“I’m honoured to have received this award and delighted that the work of doctHERs has been recognised,” Dr Saeed said. “The experience of taking part, and the high-quality mentoring and support I have received have been extremely valuable. It has been a time of real personal growth for me, as well as a time to look at the way that we have brought doctHERs from an idea to reality. The prize is also very important – it will help us launch 20 more clinics in Pakistan.”
Backing the Global Goals
The 2016 Awards categories were designed to support eight of the United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development and built on our belief that the ingenuity and determination of young entrepreneurs can help identify sustainable solutions to what are often seen as impossible problems.
CEO Paul Polman said: “I am incredibly impressed by Dr Saeed’s passion and determination. Her work and that of the other finalists shows that momentum is building behind the Sustainable Development Goals, but we still need new ideas, new energy, new business models – particularly from the young and the entrepreneurial. They need our help and support to realise their initiatives and change the world to create a bright future.”
Be part of collective action
We believe that collective action is needed to tackle the biggest challenges facing the world.

text Our latest progress report shows that we are delivering against the majority of the ambitious targets in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) – and issues a call for more collective action to tackle the biggest challenges facing the business, and the world.
Strong sustainability performance linked to growth
'Mobilising Collective Action', our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan Summary of Progress in 2015 (EN), reports against the ambitious targets we set ourselves when we embedded the USLP in our business model in 2010.
It highlights the ways we believe the USLP is creating value for our business as well as for society and the environment, by driving growth, building trust, reducing risk, and lowering costs. Sustainable Living Brands such as Knorr, Dove, Dirt is Good, Lipton and Hellmann's, which all make products directly linked to a sustainable purpose and which contribute to USLP goals, accounted for nearly half of Unilever's growth in 2015 – and grew faster than the rest of the business.
On track in our operations – but big challenges remain
The report showed strong performance against the sustainability targets within our direct control. We have helped more than 480 million people take action to improve their health and well-being, and enhanced people's livelihoods through employment, training, and advancing human rights.
We've also reduced the environmental impacts of our operations. Compared to 2008, in 2015 Unilever factories sent 97% less total waste for disposal, emitted 39% less CO2 from energy, and abstracted 37% less water per tonne of production.
But reducing the environmental impact of the consumer use of our products once they leave our factories has proven difficult. Although the waste associated with consumer disposal of our products has reduced by 29% since 2010, the water associated with consumers’ use of our products has only fallen by around 1%, and the greenhouse gas impact associated with consumers’ use has risen by around 6%.
Innovative approaches – and the need for collective action
We are adopting innovative strategies to address these issues. But changing consumer behaviour, alongside broader challenges including climate change and widening inequality, requires urgent collective action at a global level too. We are working with the global community to build on the progress made in 2015 through the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change.
"Enormous opportunities exist for those who commit to taking action..."
Describing 2015 as a 'remarkable year for humanity and the planet', Unilever CEO Paul Polman said that sustainable business models remained not just relevant, but essential.
He said: "Now entering its sixth year, the USLP is proving that there is no trade-off between sustainability and profitable growth. It is also helping us to save costs, fuel innovation and recruit and retain the best talent.
"In fact, enormous opportunities exist for those who commit to taking action. There is no business case for enduring poverty and runaway climate change."
We all have a part to play in building a brighter future. What’s yours? Share your thoughts with #collectiveaction

text Four years ago, on 3 May 2018, the European Parliament called for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics – a call we wholeheartedly support and one of the principles central to our Positive Beauty vision and strategy.
In September 2021, Members of the European Parliament went even further with a landmark vote showing their overwhelming support for a resolution to begin phasing out animal experiments. This would mean the end of animal testing in the EU for good.
Unfortunately, progress is now not just stalling, it’s also starting to take a backwards slide. Despite the European Parliament’s consistent leadership on this issue, separate regulations for cosmetics and chemicals in Europe are contradicting each other. The former bans animal testing, while the latter requires animal testing in many circumstances.
At the very centre of the issue is the EU chemicals legislation that determines how the safety of chemicals for people and the environment are assessed.
At Unilever, we don’t test on animals and we have been developing and using alternatives to animal testing to assure the safety of the products we make, and their ingredients, for more than 40 years. The next-generation, non-animal safety assessments that now exist provide significant benefits over animal-based approaches, some of which date from the first half of the last century.
Modern science enables us to predict how an ingredient, or a combination of ingredients, will interact with human biology in ways that tests on rabbits or rats simply can’t. Find out more in this short film about our next-generation risk assessments.
This leading-edge science also gives us ways to predict the impact a chemical could have when it makes its way into the environment, so we can stay well below harmful levels and help keep our planet, and the organisms living in it, safe without testing on animals.
Leadership beyond science 
To drive real change that leads to a global ban and an end to animal testing, our work goes further than the innovation of non-animal, next-generation risk assessments (NGRAs). We share our non-animal safety science openly on our website dedicated to this topic, and at scientific conferences and workshops, offering scientists around the world the opportunity to explore the approaches we are pioneering.
We focus on training others in how to use our approaches, and helping to make the science widely available. And we’ve championed its acceptance by policymakers and governments so they no longer require animal testing.
Building on all of our existing safety science, in October 2018, we announced that Unilever would join Humane Society International’s (HSI) global #BeCrueltyFree initiative, which leads legislative reform in key beauty markets to prohibit animal testing of cosmetics. As part of this, we united with HSI to launch a multi-year, open collaboration to develop capability across companies and regulatory authorities so safety decisions for cosmetics are based on non-animal approaches; and to build capability for the long term by investing in training future safety scientists in non-animal risk assessments. At the same time, Dove became the first Unilever brand to be certified by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
View a presentation from Dr Julia Fentem, Head of our Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre
It’s this model – an integrated framework of the non-animal safety science we share, more of our brands moving towards cruelty-free status, strong partnerships with NGOs, trade bodies, other companies and more, as well as advocacy among our stakeholders and withregulators – that is helping to bring about change on a global scale. It’s also why Unilever is one of just a handful of businesses recognised by PETA as a company working for regulatory change.
What’s standing in the way of a global ban?
In 2013, the EU instigated a transformational change by moving to a full ban on animal testing for cosmetics. In line with this model, 41 countries around the world now prohibit animal testing for cosmetics.
But there’s a problem. While the EU Cosmetics Regulation forbids animal testing, the EU regulation which governs chemicals, known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), still requires animal testing under many circumstances. This means there is a mismatch between the two regulations and so, while animal testing for cosmetics is banned in the EU, animal testing continues to take place under REACH.
And the problem is getting worse. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is calling for new animal tests for ingredients with a long history of safe use, even for those solely used in cosmetics. This move is now destroying the EU’s 2013 ban on animal testing for cosmetics.
What are we doing about it?
On this four-year anniversary of the European Parliament supporting a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics, we’re sharing the progress we’ve made through our commitment to champion its implementation, the challenges posed by the EU chemicals regulations, and what we’re doing about them.
Find more detail by expanding the section at the bottom of this page.
The way forward
In August 2021, Unilever’s leading experts in safety science published a paper setting out the shift that’s needed. It calls for transformational change in the way that chemical safety is assessed for regulatory purposes – to close the gap between the EU Cosmetics Regulation and REACH, by creating a future-fit regulatory framework that embraces the benefits of modern, highly innovative, non-animal safety science. Read the paper, published in the Alternatives to Laboratory Animals journal, in full here.
Until policymakers accept the leading-edge application of new approach methodologies (tests that don’t use animals), we’ll continue to advocate strongly for the regulatory changes needed to uphold the EU’s legal requirement that non-animal approaches are used if available. And on behalf of consumers, Unilever and our 31 PETA-approved brands will continue to speak out.
How you can take action
You can help too. If you’re an EU citizen, you can sign the European Citizen’s Initiative calling on the European Commission to protect its ban on animal testing for cosmetics and transform the EU chemicals regulation so there are no more loopholes.
Sign to help save the EU’s ban on animal tests for cosmetics
The Initiative, which allows people within the EU to influence the European Commission, has already reached over half a million signatures. Please sign to help save cruelty-free cosmetics and make your voice heard.
Our progress so far
October 2018 
Unilever announced support for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics (#BeCrueltyFree) and initiated a five-year partnership with HSI – now the AFSA (Animal-Free Safety Assessment) Collaboration. This is focused on developing global capability in how to make safety decisions without animal testing, to facilitate regulatory change and the implementation of animal testing bans on cosmetics globally.
August 2020 
We took a public stand against calls for new animal testing of existing ingredients, challenging the European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) administrative requests on scientific grounds. We continue to collaborate closely with animal protection organisations, The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA), trade associations and other companies to advocate for changes in EU chemicals policy and regulations.
April 2021 
We helped to #SaveRalph by supporting HSI’s hard-hitting international campaign, which contributed to Mexico becoming the 41st country to ban animal testing for cosmetics. We continue to collaborate with animal protection organisations in support of legislative changes in Latin America, South East Asia and North America.
May 2021 
Marking ten years since Unilever began working with the Chinese authorities, government laboratories and leading academics to build non-animal safety science capability, China’s new cosmetics legislation came into force. It means most imported cosmetics no longer require animal testing. While celebrating this progress, we also spoke out against the threat to the EU’s long-standing ban in this film.
August 2021 
We published an Alternatives to Laboratory Animals (ATLA) paper, calling for the EU to close the gap between regulatory chemicals testing and modern safety science.
We published and presented case studies of our non-animal, next-generation risk assessment safety methods at the 11th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences to promote the wider use of animal-free safety science.
And our Dove brand united with The Body Shop and over 100 animal protection organisations to launch Save Cruelty Free Cosmetics – a European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)campaign calling for the EU’s ban on animal testing for cosmetics to be upheld.
September 2021 
A further 27 PETA-approved Unilever brands added their support to the campaign, which has since been backed by other companies and brands, including Lush, Herbal Essences and Aesop.
April 2022 
Unilever’s input to the REACH public consultation requested flexibility to use alternatives to animal testing to address REACH information requirements. 
First series of AFSA (Animal-Free Safety Assessment Collaboration) training webinars launched on Predictive Chemistry and Consumer Exposure.
The ECI urging the European Commission to protect and strengthen the EU’s ban on animal testing for cosmetics, transform chemicals regulation, and modernise science in the EU passed half a million signatures.

text For many of us, a toothache or bleeding gums are warning signs that we need to book an appointment with the dentist. We’ll lie back in the chair, say ‘aaaaaah’, and get the expert’s advice to put things right. But for millions of people, access to dentists is almost impossible.
According to research from King’s College London (Opens in a pop-up window ), 69% of the world’s dentists serve just 27% of the global population. A World Health Organization report (Opens in a pop-up window ) also reveals that while 82% of people in high-income countries have access to oral health services, that figure plunges to just 35% in low-income countries.
By the age of 65, four out of five Ghanaians have lost all their teeth, * the average Indonesian will have 11 missing teeth, ** and in Vietnam people have lost on average six teeth. *** In Bangladesh, the average person has lost seven teeth by the time they turn 60. ****
A chronic shortage of formally trained dentists and prohibitively high costs often lead to oral health issues being ignored and treatment delayed, especially in middle and low-income countries. But Unilever’s family of oral care brands is setting out to make positive change.
Don’t wait until it’s too late, #TalkToADentist
Through ‘Don’t wait until it’s too late, #TalkToADentist’, our oral care brands are providing teledentistry services to help tackle barriers such as cost, distance and dentist availability on a vast scale. People can check in with a dentist digitally via video call, WhatsApp or live streaming on Facebook, all completely free of charge.
The brands are also organising dental camps where people will be able to access free in-person check-ups. Together these services will help an estimated 200 million people across the world take control of their oral health, avoiding severe pain, costly and complicated treatments, and ultimately tooth loss.
On a mission to eradicate oral disease
Mariano Sampietro, Global Vice President Oral Care at Unilever, says: “Our brands are on a mission to unleash the power of healthy smiles and eradicate oral disease for everyone. We believe that everyone has a right to good oral health, and access to convenient and affordable expert dental care.
“Through this campaign, we hope to raise awareness to ensure people understand the importance of acting early, from the moment a problem arises.”
text They might look and sound similar, but equality and equity are two very distinct concepts. Here’s why we need both to achieve a fairer and more socially inclusive world. 
After years of advocacy from NGOs, governments and businesses, including Unilever, an agreement has been reached to start negotiations for a global treaty to tackle plastic pollution.
We have switched our entire range of Carte D’Or in the UK from plastic packs to responsibly sourced, recyclable paper tubs and lids in a move that will save over 900 tons of virgin plastic every year.
We believe that cleaning your home shouldn’t make waste. Which is why we have developed a ground-breaking, fully recyclable spray bottle.

When we started using a revolutionary sustainable foaming agent in our Quix hand dishwash liquid in 2019, it was a world first. Now, working in partnership with Evonik, we are taking this pioneering green ingredient global.
text We come into contact with potentially harmful germs every day. However, our bodies are able to repel the vast majority thanks to tiny but mighty proteins called antimicrobial peptides. These AMPs, as they are known by scientists, are created by the skin and form its first line of defence by destroying the outer layer of the invading virus and bacteria cells as they come into contact with the skin.
Now, a new collaboration between a team of microbiologists and skin scientists at Unilever, and quantum computing and Artificial Intelligence experts at IBM Research and the Science Technology Facilities Council Hartree Centre, has shown how a common skincare ingredient can boost these natural defences.
Niacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, can boost both the numbers and effectiveness of the skin’s natural AMPs. This discovery was first made by Unilever scientists in India, but the team were keen to find out more.
Ramping up the AMPs
“We wanted to understand if the cooperative effect between vitamin B3 and natural antimicrobial peptides could help us to develop products that would complement the skin’s natural defences against harmful bacteria,” says Dr Michael Hoptroff from Unilever Research and Development. “Our experiments, combined with the STFC and IBM computational simulation work, have shown that this is indeed a possibility.”
Many skin conditions like eczema, body odour and dandruff are exacerbated when the fine balance of micro-organisms living on the skin, known as the microbiome, is disturbed.Treating these conditions requires re-establishing balance in the microbiome and creating an environment where AMPs can thrive.
Several years ago, Unilever scientists in India discovered that vitamin B3 could trigger an increase in the amount of skin-protecting AMPs produced naturally by the skin. This clearly offered a performance advantage, and it was subsequently added to products such as hand sanitisers to improve their effectiveness.
Laboratory studies further revealed that the vitamin also ramped up the potency of the AMPs, making them significantly more effective. Now, thanks to Unilever and computational scientists from the STFC Hartree Centre and IBM Research, we know why.
The power of scientific partnership
Using high-performance computing technology at the Hartree Centre and the data from the studies by Unilever scientists, IBM and STFC created computational models of bacterial and human cell membranes, as well as vitamin B3 and AMPs.
Simulations were then run using these models to see how the vitamin molecules interacted with the AMPs and the bacterial membrane; and why vitamin B3 boosted their activity.
These simulations provide a wealth of detailed insights that could become the foundation for developing new skin hygiene products and cosmetics using niacinamide – and possibly other peptide-boosting materials, while complying with applicable regulations.
“AI and computer learning could predict even more effective boosters that we are not aware of and that might need to be created by synthetic chemists,” says Dr Amitabha Majumdar, a Senior Research Scientist at Unilever.
“That is the incredible power of machine learning and AI: it can see connections in the data that we cannot and deliver results that we were looking for.”

text 1. Setting a digital standard

Producing 3 million units per day for brands like Surf Excel, Vim, Rin and Wheel, the Dapada factory began its digital journey in 2018 with the adoption of fourth-industrial revolution technology such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing and big data analytics. Just four years later, it is the first dedicated Unilever home care site to be recognised as a WEF Lighthouse factory, paving the way for rapid digital transformation in South Asia.
This is the first time an FMCG factory in India has been awarded this status, and I hope more will follow as Unilever increasingly digitalises its supply chain.
Sanjiv Mehta, President of Unilever South Asia and CEO and Managing Director of Hindustan Unilever
2. Agility for a changing market
With augmented reality, big data and analytics, Dapada has used artificial intelligence learning solutions to accelerate the pace of innovation and response to consumer demand, resulting in a 50% reduction in end-to-end product development. When a formulation change for Surf Excel was needed, for example, in order to maintain market competitiveness and counteract price rises for key raw materials, the team used a digital twin simulation model. This helped them to identify the process needed to deliver the correct formulation at the first try.
3. Protecting the planet
Thanks to machine learning and advanced analytics, water consumption and energy use were reduced at the Dapada factory by 31%, while greenhouse gas emissions were lowered by 54%. This was achieved by using simulations to test all variables, including the weather, and their effects on production. Advanced analytics were deployed to combine weather forecasts with historical energy consumption and resulted in the creation of production strategies that helped reduce specific energy consumption by 4%.
As the world grapples with many challenges, it is remarkable to see how Lighthouses are yielding sustainability benefits while achieving business goals, which we call eco-efficiency. We need them to continue illuminating the way forward for the global manufacturing community by shaping a responsible future of manufacturing that works for people, society and the environment.
Francisco Betti, Head of Shaping the Future of Advanced Manufacturing and Value Chains, World Economic Forum 
4. Future-fit people
The digital transformation of the Dapada factory has led to over 48% of the factory’s 500 workers being upskilled or reskilled through training platforms like Degreed, the Digital Training Centre and boot camps. In addition, a reward and recognition programme was created to increase workforce involvement. Pankaj Pandey, Dapada Instrumentation Lead, said: “Boot Camp has inspired me to adopt advanced technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution at a much faster pace. During the three-day programme, I learned about the power of data analytics and how it can be used.”
5. Growth
Using detailed loss-capturing systems, the Dapada team unlocked growth by improving machine and manpower productivity. Auto loss-correction systems, for example, allowed the factory to mitigate the top 80% of contributing factors responsible for slowing down the packing process. On the factory floor, a smart manning app was used to pre-attribute workstations to employees across 80,000 man–machine combinations. 
By eliminating time loss at the beginning of shifts, the system improved manpower productivity by 39%, while also maximising outputs on priority lines by matching high-skilled workers to them. The VIM portfolio, which has shown significant double-digit growth over the last five years, is just one example of a brand that has benefited from these logistical improvements.
text Using cutting-edge, data-driven technology, we can optimise our on-shelf presence, both in physical stores and digital commerce, ensuring that we provide our consumers with the products they want, in the formats they want, through the channels they use – as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Optimising our wide-ranging portfolio of brands and products involves a process called SKU (stock-keeping unit) simplification. This is how we determine whether a particular item should be kept on the shelf or discontinued.
Delisting low-performing products allows us to make room for growth: to focus more on our core SKUs, develop new products in response to changing consumer needs and create tailored plans for our customers.
To do this, we’re using a new data-driven tool that gives us a holistic and granular assessment of our portfolio through advanced analytics and insights. It brings together the best of machine and human intelligence to allow us to make faster better-informed decisions.
This is a big step on our journey to becoming a truly data-intelligent organisation, where every decision and action is powered by the best data and advanced analytics to deliver our future-fit Compass strategy
Steve McCrystal, Chief Enterprise Technology Officer
How it works
The tool crunches the data and makes a delist recommendation based on the benefit to our customers (retail partners), our consumers (by looking at what shoppers are actually buying) and Unilever (is it driving profitable growth?).
This three-lens approach is a sophisticated way to assess and manage our portfolio, recommending which SKUs to delist, watch, protect or grow.
Our in-market teams are able to understand their top performers and – where there are opportunities – to invest more with SKUs that may be in the middle of the pack. The approach improves their focus on where they need to direct action. It also allows them to track their overall portfolio performance.
While the system is a highly advanced data-driven platform, it stills needs a human touch. The final decision sits with the in-market teams. And there are reasons why they may decide to keep a low-ranking SKU. As one example, a SKU may be a recent launch and is just now getting established.
There are big gains to be made in time, cost and capacity at every stage of the delist process, from the moment we stop production and start liquidating inventory (less warehousing, waste and transport) through to resetting our capacity (improving our productivity and freeing up space).
A big step towards true data intelligence
The approach leverages the vast amount of data available to us, to give an accurate, insightful and actionable view of our portfolio. It segments the data by category, customer, brand and channel and also provides a total market and cross-market picture of delisting opportunities.
We’ve rolled the tool out in Canada, the US, Europe, Africa and Latin America. Our plan is for the platform to be live across all our operations by the end of the second quarter this year.
“The capability brings together the perspectives of our customers, shoppers and business to make better, faster decisions that create growth for our business and for our customers,” explains Morgan Vawter, Unilever’s Global VP, Data Centre of Excellence. “This is supported by clear targets from our leadership and by robust end-to-end governance. The tool gives us visibility of each SKU delisting execution, so we have full traceability of every step to realising its value.”
“The opportunities to save cash and deliver fuel for growth are huge, and we’re already seeing the results,” adds Steve McCrystal, Chief Enterprise Technology Officer, “This is a big step on our journey to becoming a truly data-intelligent organisation, where every decision and action is powered by the best data and advanced analytics to deliver our future-fit Compass strategy.”
text Dafydd Farr-Jones has been an executive PA for 20 years, three of them at Unilever. And while he’s never hidden his sexuality in any of his roles, Unilever is the only company where he’s felt comfortable enough to be a proud and open member of a global network of LGBTQI+ colleagues and allies.
“Unilever’s proUd network not only offered me community, acceptance, support and understanding, it’s also felt like a friendly, safe and inclusive space. A space that can make a difference and where I could make a difference. It made me proUd to be part of Unilever,” he says.
It’s a view seconded by Angharad Stevens, Category Strategy Assistant Manager for Skin Care. “You cannot over-estimate how mentally freeing it is to know you don’t have to hide any aspect of yourself. And our community is an incredible group of people, I wouldn’t miss knowing and being known by them for the world,” she says.
“In the past, the way my sexuality and identity have been approached by peers has been the decider on my future in that role, both positive and negative. My ideas and thoughts are in part formed because of who I am and my experiences. If my voice is valued in a creative process, then you have to respect and appreciate these come from my life as a lesbian marketer,” she adds.
A safe space
Since its founding three years ago, proUd has set out to be a beacon of inclusion for the LGBTQI+ community and allies, amplifying their voice in society and at Unilever. It has also grown from 250 colleagues to 1,200 worldwide.
Every one of them has access to a private membership group on Microsoft Teams, ensuring their privacy and safety. An important measure for those who live in countries where they aren’t free to be their true, authentic selves and their human rights are severely compromised.
“In Africa I've felt like an outcast and lived in fear of being exposed for many years,” one proUd member explained in a private chat. “The opportunity to interact with non-judgemental colleagues who understand the experiences of LGBTQI+ people really comforts me.”
Equity, equality and why we need both
Whether it is an inclusive definition of family that allows for benefits coverage for couples who cannot legally marry, or a change of gender expression policies, the aim is the same – levelling the playing field so that all employees have access to equal treatment and opportunities. One of proUd’s aims is to identify core policy changes which will better support the community within Unilever.
Achieving this goal lies principally in providing equity. Although often used interchangeably, equity and equality are two very separate concepts. If equality is the ultimate objective, where all individuals are valued and receive the same conditions and treatment, equity is the way we will achieve it.
This is because by putting equity at the centre of the discussion on inclusion, we are in effect recognising the working and cultural practices that prevent specific groups of people from enjoying certain rights and opportunities. And having identified them, we are in a much stronger position to overcome them.
Levelling the playing field for everyone
Although we are aware that we still have a long way to go to be fully inclusive, real progress has been made, including:
proUd network: 
Now comprising over 1,200 members, with chapters in countries all over the world, our proUd resource network plays an essential role in supporting employees and creating change in the workplace.
Wellbeing and life stages support: 
We have introduced wellbeing and HR policies that include flexible approaches in maternity, paternity and parental leave that consider LGBTQI+ people’s needs as well as breakthrough policies covering fertility and transition. Unilever Singapore, for example, has recently changed its employee health policy to include same sex partners and different types of families.
Talent management and culture: 
Our new policies reduce the challenges that still exist for LGBTQI+ people in relation to career progression. These include interventions to reduce biases in appointments, promotions and global mobility opportunities aimed at creating a more inclusive workplace.
Education and understanding: 
We also offer training modules on our internal Degreed learning platform, including guidance on inclusive language and becoming an LGBTQI+ ally.
The serious business beyond celebrating rainbows
But as we ready ourselves for the joy and celebrations of Pride month, it also important to acknowledge that there is still much more to be done to ensure the rights of the global LGBTQI+ community – not least in the business sector.
Recognising our own uneven landscape, in 2018 Unilever signed the UN LGBTQI+ Standards of Conduct for Business with the aim of accelerating positive change by adopting its five pillars of conduct for tackling discrimination at work. And in 2020 we furthered our commitment to inclusion by signing the Declaration of Amsterdam, a global statement of support for LGBTQI+ rights.
But we also operate in a world where more than half of UN member states still have no protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment.
Where half of Fortune 500 companies provide benefits for LGBTQI+ domestic partners.
And where the LGBTQI+ community’s rights are under threat, with Florida state’s passing of ‘Don’t say Gay’ bill and the UK’s tempering of its bill on conversion therapy to exclude rights for the trans community.
So where do we go from here?
“As Unilever, we have both a platform and a responsibility to promote positive change,” says Aline Santos, Chief Brand Officer and Chief Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Officer for Global Marketing. “And we can and should do this by fostering inclusion within and beyond the Unilever ecosystem.”
Through our brands and our Unstereotype framework, for example, we are working to increase the representation of the LGBTQI+ community in the media. In recent research on media representation of the LGBTQI+ community conducted by ad agency Karmarama and Gay Times magazine, 72% of those surveyed think the way they are presented in advertising is tokenistic.
“It’s clear LGBTQI+ consumers don’t see themselves represented in media and comms, and by increasing this representation we can save lives,” adds Business Development Marketing Manager Julian Gomez.
“And while that might sound like a bold statement, we know there’s a direct link between lack of representation (and protection) and suicide rates among the community.”
To improve representation, we’ve partnered with Gay Times to create a LGBTQI+ playbook for marketers as part of Act 2 Unstereotype, to educate, inspire and give guidance to our marketers.
“I’ve been gay for 48 years and a marketer for 24 but I couldn’t define what to do to address the community needs by myself. It’s too rich,” says Julian.
“One of the most incredible things about our community is just how rich and diverse we are and it’s crucial we have the right voices at the table to represent us,” Angharad adds.
“And while we currently offer only offer the playbook to our own marketers and agencies, we are looking at the option of providing it as an open-source document,” says Aline. “In this way, we hope to shine a light for others and become the beacon of inclusivity we aspire to be.”
text Plastic plays a significant role in preventing food waste. It has an exceptional ability to keep out air, moisture and bacteria that can cause products to go off before they’re cooked or eaten. And it’s often the most efficient and cost-effective material to package food for transportation and storage.
In a recent survey by Boston Consulting Group of 15,000 people globally, 83% of millennial and Gen Z consumers said they’d be willing to pay more for products that came in sustainable packaging.
This demand has triggered a new ecosystem of alternative packaging materials and new business models, including the use of recycled and recyclable plastic graded especially for food products to ensure safety.
To respond to consumer demand and tackle plastic waste, our R&D teams are working to develop solutions to keep plastics in the circular economy alongside finding new materials to replace virgin single-use plastic.
Closing the loop on plastic packaging waste
A circular economy only works if the food packaging, after its intended use, returns into the economy for use as food packaging again.
However, there is currently no uniform legislative framework in place for the use of recycled plastics in food packaging. So, while demand for recycled plastic is set to grow, we need clear and consistent legislation with industry support to scale up and supply food-grade recycled plastic.
Using mechanical and advanced recycling to increase supply
“Presently, there is not enough supply of recycled plastics to meet the needs for use as food packaging,” says F&R Packaging Capability Director Sanjeev Das.
There’s limited availability of food-grade recycled plastics, especially food-grade recycled polypropylene (rPP) and polyethylene (rPE) plastics which account for 75% of the plastics used in our food packaging.
This has seen our Foods and Refreshment R&D team work to create sustainable sources using two complementary routes.
The first is mechanical recycling which sees items sorted according to their material. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic used to make plastic bottles is sorted into one recycling stream, polyethylene (PE) used to make plastic bags into another.
Once separated, they’re cleaned and transformed into recycled raw material to make new items. All our Hellmann’s plastics bottles and jars in the US and Canada are made from 100% recycled and recyclable plastic that’s been recovered this way.
The second way we’re increasing the supply of recycled plastic is through advanced recycling. This sees mixed plastic waste broken down into its fundamental building blocks and reconstructed to make new plastic packaging that’s especially suitable for food-grade packaging.
Working with our partner SABIC, we use this technology to provide us with ready access to food-grade recycled polypropylene plastic to make our 30 million Magnum pint tubs sold throughout Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
To scale up, we need common policies and legislation
As it stands, however, we have the technology but not the common standards and scale.
“To aid the circular transformation of food packaging, there is an urgent need for alignment on goals and related policies. This would enable further investments in collection, sorting and recycling infrastructure and technologies, including mechanical and advanced recycling,” says Sanjeev.
It’s only with a common policy framework and industry collaboration that we can begin to make real progress in creating sustainable supplies of food-grade recycled plastic and the scale to meet increasing demand.
The more others come on board and seek to tackle this together, the bigger the impact we can have to help us achieve our vision of a waste-free world.
text We have joined forces with the UK government’s Department for International Development to target a billion people worldwide with a Covid-19 handwashing campaign.
The initiative – backed by £50 million each from Unilever and UK aid – will support programmes aimed at raising awareness and changing behaviour, to make sure people are washing their hands with soap regularly and disinfecting surfaces.
It will also provide over 20 million hygiene products in the developing world, including in areas where there is little or no sanitation, or poor health systems.
Such support is vital to stop the spread of the disease in the developing world and will help limit its spread in the UK. Tackling the disease in developing countries will also reduce its potential future impact on the global economy and travel.
Underpinned by vast expertise
The mass awareness campaign will run across TV, radio and print as well as social media to help change people’s behaviour in countries across Africa and Asia, like Kenya, Ghana and Bangladesh. Messages will be tailored to communities in these countries to ensure they are effective.
The initiative will be led by our Domestos and Lifebuoy brands, which have been driving large-scale hygiene behaviour change programmes for decades. And it will harness the expertise of leading academics – including from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine – to analyse and ensure the programme is targeted where it has the biggest impact.
“Lifebuoy and Domestos have a proven track record of running hygiene awareness and education programmes successfully, and we hope that the work we will be able to drive jointly with UK aid will help save lives that could otherwise be impacted by coronavirus,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope.
“As the world’s biggest soap company, we have a responsibility to help make soap and hygiene products more readily available and to use our expertise to teach people to wash their hands effectively, whichever brand they choose to use.”
“Health experts have said washing your hands regularly and staying away from other people are the most effective ways to stop this virus from spreading and to save lives,” adds Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the UK government’s Secretary of State for International Development.
“Many people in the poorest countries lack access to basic handwashing products, such as soap, or are not aware of the urgent need to change their behaviour. The UK government’s partnership with Unilever will make a real difference, helping to protect both developing countries and the UK from further infections.”
Well positioned to help
Unilever’s broad range of hygiene brands in the UK and in low and middle-income countries means we are well positioned to support the UK government to step up its response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Our Lifebuoy handwashing programmes have already reached over 450 million people over the last ten years, tackling diseases like rotavirus and typhoid which spread easily through people’s hands.
Our Domestos programmes have helped 28 million people over the last eight years get improved access to toilets in schools and communities, ensuring facilities are kept clean and safe for longer.
This latest initiative with the UK government builds on a series of actions Unilever is taking to tackle the coronavirus outbreak globally.
text When it comes to laundry, capsules are the fastest-growing format in the majority of the developed world. Now our biggest laundry brand, Dirt Is Good (DIG, also known as Persil, Skip and OMO) is launching a capsule that’s designed to deliver tough stain removal as well as significant reductions in carbon emissions and plastic waste.
The capsules have been reformulated and optimised for use in cold (20°C and below), short laundry cycles. A move that reduces our manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions by 16% 1 and will help consumers save up to 60% energy per use at home and equivalent greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of the product, without compromising on the top cleaning performance of Dirt Is Good.
Plant-based ingredients and plastic-free packs
Building on Unilever’s Clean Future strategy, through which we are investing €1 billion over ten years to change the way our cleaning products are created, manufactured and packaged, the re-engineered capsules contain powerful biodegradable active ingredients, 65% of which are derived from plant sources. And the packaging is kinder to the planet too.
For the first time ever, DIG’s capsules will be sold in a plastic-free 2, fully recyclable cardboard box, a move set to save around 6,000 tonnes of plastic per year, the equivalent in weight to 500 double-decker buses.
Half the cardboard is recycled, the rest is from Forest Stewardship Council-certified forests 3, in line with our commitments to reduce plastic packaging and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain. The innovative box, designed in partnership with Graphic Packaging International, is built to lock out moisture even more effectively than current plastic packaging to prevent capsules from sticking together. It’s also easier to open and close, yet it's also child-safe and fully recyclable.
Making our brands the compelling choice for consumers
“Through our Clean Future strategy, our ambition is to make our brands the compelling choice for consumers by bringing real innovations to mass market products,” says Dr Keith Rutherford, Head of Global Innovation, Unilever Home Care R&D.

Dr Keith Rutherford, Head of Global Innovation, Unilever Home Care R&D 
“The level of research, development, and manufacturing and supply chain overhaul that goes into pulling these innovations together in a single product shouldn’t be underestimated. The breakthrough formulation, format and packaging are the work of multiple R&D teams, and we couldn’t be prouder of the result. The new generation DIG capsule and packaging are truly industry leading.”
“Working together with Unilever, we are delighted to see our innovative packaging solution launch under this iconic brand around the world,” adds Ralf Mack, Director of New Business Development, EU Consumer Products at Graphic Packaging International.
“Our combined expertise in carton design, product protection capabilities and understanding of consumer behaviour has enabled us to create this superior, plastic-free and child-proof solution, enabling consumers and businesses alike to reduce their use of single-use plastic.”
The global roll-out of the new capsules will first launch in France and will soon reach other brands in the range all over the world.
text Unilever has become a founding member of a new group of cosmetics and personal care businesses in Europe who are pledging to raise the bar on sustainable, ethical and responsible practices and take ambitious action on the planet’s most pressing challenges.
The Cosmetics Europe Commit for our Planet initiative (Opens in a pop-up window ) launched on 7 December to drive industry-wide sustainability commitments that are inclusive, measurable and adapted to ever-changing social and environmental needs across three key themes: 
Climate
Packaging
Nature.
Only by working together can we truly reduce our environmental footprint in Europe.
Rebecca Marmot, Unilever Chief Sustainability Officer
Every founding ‘Pioneer’ member of the initiative – from global corporates like Unilever to SMEs and start-ups – is tasked with charting its own course for sustainability. The aim is to amplify efforts through joint action to harness the collective power of the beauty sector.
At Unilever, our commitment to sustainability is embedded through our purpose, vision, business model and strategy – the Unilever Compass – which outlines our five strategic choices for growth and the important role that our sustainability agenda plays in this. The Compass sets out sustainability commitments to improve the health of the planet, improve people’s health, confidence and well-being, and contribute to a fairer, more socially inclusive world.
Here is a high-level look at some of our Compass commitments:
Our purpose
Purpose underpins every part of this work, as Chief Sustainability Officer Rebecca Marmot explains:
“At Unilever, our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace. It is something we believe in passionately and wholeheartedly, which is why we are proud to be a Pioneer of the Cosmetics Europe Commit for Our Planet initiative,” she says.
“We have a long history of putting sustainability at the heart of our growth strategy but know how important it is to join forces across the entire cosmetics industry on this vital agenda to ensure we maximise our impact. Only by working together can we truly reduce our environmental footprint in Europe.”
text The health of our planet has reached a dangerous tipping point, with a massive loss of nature and biodiversity putting economies at risk and threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.
We cannot save the climate without saving biodiversity. The flipside of that is also true: if we fail to protect the natural world, we lose our biggest asset in the fight against climate change.
At Unilever, many of the raw materials we use in our brands come from farms and forests. And with naturals trends on the increase, this may grow over time.
That’s why the next two years are the critical window of opportunity for the world – and especially for businesses like ours – to speed up the development and adoption of solutions, and make the right collective choices about how we feed ourselves, protect nature and avoid global ecological chaos.
But while the issues we face are immediate and acute, there is hope.
The business community is getting behind the global biodiversity agenda. There’s momentum building ahead of the Convention on Biological Diversity taking place in Beijing next year, just as there was in the lead up to the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in 2015.
Why is nature important for business?
All businesses depend on nature to a greater or lesser degree. For example, they need access to resources such as food, fuel and minerals, and rely on ecosystems such as clean water, air and healthy soil. With that dependency comes risk, most notably the predictability and resilience of supply chains.
At the same time, there are huge economic opportunities associated with more sustainable practices. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Better Business, Better World report identified around $3 trillion in opportunities in food and land system transformation alone.
The potential for growth resulting from eco-innovations that both protect the environment and advance human welfare is vast.
Our Planet: Our Business
This momentum within the business community is being fuelled in part by a documentary called Our Planet: Our Business.
Following the huge success of Netflix’s Our Planet series, which launched in April 2019, this new film has been produced by the award-winning team behind the series specifically for a business audience. It combines stunning wildlife footage with the voices of influential business leaders.
The film shows how economic stability depends on nature’s stability – we can’t have one without the other. And like the Our Planet series, it has a positive message that change is possible and businesses can play a fundamental role in saving the planet.
Unilever playing a leading role
Unilever has a long history of helping to address many of the areas highlighted in the film, especially through our Sustainable Living Plan.
For example, protecting biodiversity is central to our Sustainable Agriculture Programme, which was inspired by our ambition to buy agricultural raw materials from farms applying sustainable agricultural practices – growing crops in ways which sustain the soil, minimise water and fertiliser use, protect biodiversity and enhance farmers’ livelihoods.
We’re also investing a huge amount into developing new packaging solutions that use less, better and no plastic, including options around refill and reuse. And we made an industry-leading public commitment in 2015 to become carbon positive in our operations by 2030.
Greater power through partnerships
As Marc Engel, Unilever's Chief Supply Chain Officer, says: “Through the pioneering work of our sustainable sourcing team in developing tools such as the Sustainable Agriculture Code, Unilever has been at the forefront of the business response to biodiversity loss.
“But the issue is now urgent, and all businesses must do more to understand and manage their footprint. We were delighted that, last month, leading business organisations came together to launch the Business for Nature coalition which is calling for action to reverse nature loss and restore the planet’s vital natural systems.”
Unilever is also part of other coalitions working to further this agenda. These include the World Economic Forum’s Nature Action Agenda, which brings together governments, business, investors and civil society to cooperate for action on biodiversity, and One Planet Business for Biodiversity, which aims to create a movement of private companies around concrete transformative actions in their supply chains that protect and/or restore biodiversity.
You can support the movement of people calling on world leaders to protect our natural world.

text It may come as a surprise to learn that Unilever is the world’s largest tea company. We have a portfolio of more than 30 brands including Lipton – the world’s most popular tea – as well as other household names such as Brooke Bond, Pure Leaf and Tazo.
We buy 10% of the global supply of black tea a year from 21 different countries. These range from India and China to Argentina and Australia, as well as three Unilever-owned estates in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda.
That equates to 143 billion servings per year. Or, to put it another way, over 270,000 cups of Unilever tea are brewed every minute of every day.
Black and green tea – or Camellia sinensis, to give the plant its proper name – makes up 90% of our tea business. And it’s the details of where we source the leaves for our tea blends – for all our brands across all countries – that we have just made public.
Transparency is the basis for action
As such a big buyer of tea, we are continually working to make our supply chain more sustainable. This starts with caring about the people who pick our leaves and goes all the way through to how we blend and package our products, and the environmental impact tea production has on the planet.
Our brands connect us to millions of people whose livelihoods depend on tea production, and to the ecosystems they share – including on 750,000 smallholdings, mostly in Africa and Asia.
For some time, we have had full traceability of where our tea comes from, which has guided our efforts to make a positive impact in the sector. Through increasing transparency across our global supply chain, we believe we can accelerate our ongoing efforts to transform the entire tea industry.
We’re determined to make our tea supply chain even more socially and environmentally sustainable, from tea estate to tea pot, and this is a great step to help us do that. Mick Van Ettinger, Unilever’s Executive Vice President for Tea 
The uplifting stories of workers and their families
As part of publishing our global supplier list, we have created an interactive map that highlights some of the social programmes we are leading on the ground with NGOs and supplier partners. These programmes aim to enhance the livelihoods and wellbeing of local workers, farmers and their families.
The story of Pinky in Assam, north-east India, is a great example.
To earn a living, farmers often sell their best crops. This leaves them with a monotonous diet of rice, maize and wheat which, while inexpensive and filling, lacks much-needed nutrition. Poor hygiene is also a big problem, with diarrhoea being the second biggest killer of children under five years old.
Our Seeds of Prosperity programme – a joint initiative with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and IDH (The Sustainable Trade Initiative) – promotes the importance of nutritious foods, a diverse diet and handwashing with soap. Families are also given the means to create kitchen gardens to grow their own vegetables.
A tea picker for 30 years, Pinky used to feel dizzy and often faint, not realising that her poor diet was the cause. Since going through the Seeds of Prosperity programme, she understands the need to eat a variety of healthy foods. This is knowledge she’s also now passing on to her daughters.
Watch this short virtual reality video to get a fascinating glimpse into Pinky’s world.
Addressing some big challenges
Pinky is part of a broad and complex supply chain which involves an estimated workforce of nearly 1 million people. This inevitably brings challenges. For instance, we know that human rights abuses persist in some of the countries we source our tea from.
That’s where our Responsible Sourcing Policy comes in. This underpins our commitment to conduct business with integrity, openness and respect for universal human rights and core labour principles throughout our supply chain.
We have a range of programmes that address specific human rights issues around tea. These include women’s safety and labour conditions on tea estates in regions such as Assam in India and Kericho in Kenya, where we continue to work to eradicate unacceptable practices. Last year, in partnership with UN Women, we launched A Global Women’s Safety Framework in Rural Spaces (PDF 6.53 MB). The Framework aims to empower women and girls socially, economically and politically, and it helps tea producers to understand the issues facing women, then how to identify and prevent them.
Working with partners, like UN Women and GAIN, enables us to tackle wider social and environmental issues, on an even bigger scale.
For example, in 2017 we became a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), a not-for-profit organisation that brings together the world’s most influential tea businesses to create a fairer, better and more sustainable tea industry for workers, farmers and the environment.
We are a signatory to the Malawi Tea 2020 programme, a first-of-its-kind partnership that aims to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the Malawian industry to help move towards the point where workers are getting paid a living wage and small-scale farmers are earning a living income.
We were also founding members of trustea, the Indian tea industry collaboration on sustainability. Trustea verification guarantees the social, economic, agronomic and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and ‘bought leaf factories’ – factories that buy tea from multiple sources.
Mick Van Ettinger, Unilever’s Executive Vice President for Tea, says: “With transparency comes transformation. Greater scrutiny of our supply chain helps us work more effectively with partners and suppliers to bring about positive change for people and planet. We want all our consumers to be part of this process too, so they can see where their tea comes from and how we are supporting the communities we work with. We’re determined to make our tea supply chain even more socially and environmentally sustainable, from tea estate to tea pot, and this is a great step to help us do that.”

text There is a lot of plastic pollution in the environment. And the fact of the matter is – too much of it carries our name.
That is not OK with us.
Plastic is a valuable material. It is crucial for the safe and efficient distribution of our products, and it has a lower carbon footprint than many alternative materials. So, it has its place.
But that place is definitely not littering our streets, rivers and oceans.
It is, however, inside the circular economy – where it is reused, recycled or composted. And where it is kept in a loop, to stop it from ever finding its way into the environment.
If even one of our bottles ends up in the environment, that’s one too many. Our plastic is our responsibility.
That’s why, today, we’re announcing new goals, that are even bolder than the ones we’ve been working towards up until now.
We are committing to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging, and collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell… all by 2025.
1/2By 2025, reduce the amount of virgin plastic in our packaging by 50%
MoreBy 2025, help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell
When it comes to virgin plastic, we will deliver this in two ways. Firstly, by removing more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging by accelerating multi-use packs – such as reusable and refillable formats – and ‘no plastic’ solutions, which includes alternative packaging materials and ‘naked’ products. Secondly, by accelerating our use of recycled plastic in our packaging.
The most important step in eliminating plastic waste is preventing it getting into the environment. That’s why we’re also committing to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell. We’ll do that in three ways: invest and partner to improve waste management infrastructure in many of the countries in which we operate; purchase and use recycled plastics in our packaging; and participate in extended producer responsibility schemes where we pay for the collection of our packaging.
We can only eliminate plastic waste by acting fast and taking radical action at all points in the cycle.
Alan Jope, CEO, Unilever
“We can only eliminate plastic waste by acting fast and taking radical action at all points in the cycle,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to our packaging and products. It requires us to introduce new and innovative materials, and scale up new business models, like reuse and refill formats, at an unprecedented speed and intensity.”
“Our vision is a world in which everyone works together to ensure that plastic stays in the economy and out of the environment. Our plastic is our responsibility and so we are committed to collecting back more than we sell, as part of our drive towards a circular economy. This is a daunting but exciting task which will help drive global demand for recycled plastic.”
On any given day, around 2.5 billion people, across more than 190 countries, use our products to feel good, look good and get more out of life. This puts us in a unique position to be part of the solution and realise our vision for a waste-free world where no packaging ever enters the environment – on land, in waterways and in our oceans.
Ellen MacArthur, Founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, says: "Today’s announcement by Unilever is a significant step in creating a circular economy for plastic. By eliminating unnecessary packaging through innovations such as refill, reuse and concentrates – while increasing their use of recycled plastic – Unilever is demonstrating how businesses can move away from virgin plastic.
“We urge others to follow their lead, so collectively we can eliminate the plastic we don’t need, and also innovate, so what we do need is circulated, and ultimately build an economic system where plastic packaging never becomes waste."
A few of the initiatives we’re working on
Since 2017, we have been transforming our use of plastic packaging. Here are some of the initiatives we’re working on and examples of where we’re helping to develop plastic collection and processing infrastructure.
We’re exploring new ways of packaging and delivering products, including concentrates, such as our new Cif ecorefill – a 10x concentrated refill that allows shoppers to buy one spray bottle, which they can then use for life. This innovation uses 75% less plastic. And there are additional benefits. Diluting the product at home means 97% less water being transported, 87% fewer trucks on the road and less greenhouse gas emissions. 
Our ice cream brand Solero has trialled an innovative box with built-in compartments so that individual ice creams can be inserted without a plastic wrapper, resulting in 35% less plastic per pack. The box is made from a specially designed PE (Polyethylene) coated cardboard. The design ensures Solero lovers can enjoy the ice lollies without compromising on quality. This trial is the latest innovation in our #GetPlasticWise initiative which aims to rethink plastic in the UK. The plan is about working with partners to seek solutions, as well as supporting and educating consumers on how they can reduce plastic consumption. 
We’re trialling new refill stations for shampoo and laundry detergent in shops, universities and mobile vending in South East Asia. For example, a pilot from All Things Hair – our content platform for hair inspiration and advice – brought a whole new model of eco-friendly shopping to consumers in the Philippines. We’re also experimenting with a refill model that comes to the consumer, rather than the consumer going to a store. In Chile, we’re partnering with Algramo to pilot an app-powered, intelligent dispensing system that uses electric tricycles to deliver to people’s homes. 
We’re developing pioneering innovations such as the new detectable pigment being used by Axe (Lynx) and TRESemmé. This makes black plastic recyclable, as it can now be seen and sorted by recycling plant scanners. The new technology means that an additional 2,500 tonnes of plastic bottles could now potentially be sorted and sent for recycling each year in the UK alone. We will share our work and the insights generated with other manufacturers to enable wide use of this technology and approach. 
We’re bringing innovations to the market including shampoo bars, refillable toothpaste tablets, cardboard deodorant sticks and bamboo toothbrushes. We have also signed up to Loop, a global, first-of-its-kind, waste-free shopping system, where you buy products in packaging that can be returned and refilled. The system brings together major brands and retailers with the idea of shifting from a model that is ‘disposable’ (where packaging is thrown away or recycled after use) to one that is ‘durable’ (where packaging is reused and any leftover product is either recycled or reused). 
Our sweet soy sauce brand in Indonesia, Bango, is switching to 100% recycled and recyclable bottles. Bango is our first Foods & Refreshment brand in our South East Asia and Australasia region to launch this innovation, with deployment of the new bottles for the 275ml and 135ml products starting in August. The change will apply to 33 million bottles and reduce over 500 tonnes of plastic waste every year. The marketing campaign promoting the launch aims to encourage consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle, particularly when it comes to plastic packaging. 
We’re helping to create a circular economy for plastic packaging in many countries. For example, we have launched 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) – and fully recyclable – bottles for our FAB laundry detergent brand in Colombia and Sunlight dishwashing liquid in South Africa. For us to hit our 25% recycled plastic content target, we need lots of PCR. So, in places like Brazil, where collection and recycling are still being developed, we need to support it. And that’s exactly what we’ve been doing with a local recycler called Wise. 
Over the last five years, we have collaborated with many partners to collect plastic packaging, including the United Nations Development Programme to help segregate, collect and recycle packaging across India. To help boost recycling rates and develop a functioning infrastructure in Indonesia, we are involved in a number of partnerships and programmes. We also raise awareness of recycling and support local collection through various initiatives, such as community-based waste banks, where individuals sort their waste and deposit it in exchange for money. 
Waste management is a huge issue in Africa and Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, is no exception. The city produces around 2,400 tonnes a day, of which roughly 60% is collected and only around 10% recycled. The rest is dumped illegally or burned. To help address this problem, we got together with Mr Green Africa. This partnership has seen us unlock sustainable solutions to plastic waste management in Kenya, integrating a social component which has helped create more opportunities and employment to over 2,000 waste pickers who were previously ignored. 
How will we reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use? 
Our commitment will strengthen our innovation in new business models, such as reusable and refillable packaging. We will also drive action around no plastic solutions, such as ‘naked’ products. And we will look at reducing the amount of plastic we use in our packs through things like concentration. We will be mindful to avoid innovations or switches that have a worse environmental impact.
Will we shift to reusable and refillable solutions? 
Our ambition is to change the way we do business which means shifting from single to multi-use packs by investing in new models, such as reusable containers. We are already learning and making progress with innovations like home refills and in-store dispensing trials. To help make this shift, we also need to work with others on these solutions, engage citizens around the experience and educate them on the benefits of changing the way they buy.
Will we reduce our plastic packaging in every country? 
Like our existing commitments, we will embed these goals across our business to ensure our brands, markets and divisions are accountable for progress. And our ‘less, better, no’ framework will guide our solutions. We expect this will show up in different ways for each country, depending on the existing packaging footprint, solutions available and consumer response.
Will we reduce the number of sachets we sell? 
Our commitment includes all plastic packaging formats across the business, including sachets. We will continue to explore the positive impact of new business models like reusable or refillable packaging. For instance, our Philippines Hair Refillery and our Love Beauty and Planet Refillery in Vietnam. Our insights highlight the need for a low-cost model where consumers can control the amount of product they dispense, which in turn manages the cost. In addition, we consider the systems in which our products flow and work with others so the plastics we do need can be collected and recycled. We have committed to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell – this includes sachets.
text Girls deserve equality. Empowerment. The opportunity to fulfil their potential. And International Day of the Girl on Friday 11 October aims to highlight the challenges they face in claiming those rights.
Two of our biggest brands – Sunsilk and Dove – are marking the event. They’re using their global reach to shatter outdated stereotypes about girls’ abilities and ambitions and teach girls the power of strong self-esteem.
They’ve also got some brilliant role models on board: young women who have spoken out, broken boundaries and are determined to help others do the same. Read on to find out more about them.
Opening up possibilities for girls everywhere
Hair brand Sunsilk is on a mission to inspire girls to dream of a future full of possibility, unlimited by what society says they should or can’t do.
The brand has teamed up with the International Center for Research on Women to publish a white paper which underlines the global challenges girls and young women are facing and what Sunsilk is doing to help.
Sunsilk’s Explore More! education programme in Thailand and Pakistan, in partnership with NGO Girl Rising, visits girls in schools, equipping them with the skills to identify their strengths, re-imagine their goals, and exercise agency to achieve them. In 2020 the Explore More! programme will be expanded to schools in Argentina, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam with the aim of reaching 50,000 more students.
Sunsilk is also using digital platforms to make an impact. Its #Juntasarrasamos app in Brazil (it means ‘Together We Rock’ in Portuguese) is a thriving interactive platform where girls can explore inspirational content by real-life role models and take part in games and quizzes that help develop their skill sets. To date the app has already reached more than 350,000 girls.
The brand’s ads and campaigns are reaching millions of young women with positive messages too. Across the globe, Sunsilk ads showcase female role models who go beyond social conventions to excel in their dreams. In time for International Day of the Girl, Sunsilk has launched its Rethink Pink campaign in Argentina. It celebrates what ‘Pink’ means – standing for possibilities instead of limitations, and features key role models such as Argentinian professional footballer Maca Sanchez.
Meet some of the brilliant young women supporting Sunsilk’s campaigns below.
Building self-esteem worldwide
Since 2004, the Dove Self-Esteem Project has helped bring body confidence and self-esteem education to more than 35 million young people globally. It’s on track to reach 40 million by the end of 2020, as the world’s largest provider of self-esteem and body confidence programming.
It’s making this massive impact through educational tools delivered in partnership with schools, youth organisations, parents and mentors. Having low body confidence and self-esteem holds young girls back. These tools ensure the next generation can grow up to enjoy a positive relationship with the way they look, which has a positive impact on their wellbeing and happiness.
Dove Day, which coincides with the International Day of the Girl, is an annual event where Unilever employees all over the world have a chance to get involved in the brand’s social mission. 2019 marks the seventh year running that they have been invited to volunteer their time to experience the impact of the Dove Self-Esteem Project first hand by helping to run workshops in local schools.
This year, employees from more than 30 different countries are taking part, facilitating workshops to reach more than 20,000 young people. In London and South-East England alone, more than 180 employees and agency partners are visiting seven schools to conduct 60 workshops for 1,600 students over two days.
The Dove Self-Esteem Project’s Free Being Me partnership with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) is also reaching millions of girls with self-esteem and body confidence education, and inspiring young women to have their voices heard. Since 2013, ‘Free Being Me’ has reached 6 million young people in 128 countries.
In 2017, WAGGGS and Dove launched a new Action on Body Confidence badge. Girl Guides and Girl Scouts can earn the badge by addressing the issue of body confidence in their communities. They’re encouraged to use their advocacy skills to share their knowledge on the issue, show they refuse to be defined by their looks, and inspire girls around them with their passion.
Read about some of their experiences below.
The role models inspiring girls globally
Rabika, Pakistan
Sunsilk ambassador Rabika is a software developer, based in Pakistan.
In a country where only 14% of women work in tech, Rabika is one of few women who has been able to make it her career. She and her best friend were the only girls to enrol onto the computer science programme at university.
With the support of their families, and one another, they have defied social expectations, receiving the highest grades in the year and winning an award for their final project.
Ashley, Canada
Ashley is Senior Brand Manager for Unilever brands Love Beauty & Planet and Nexxus, based in Toronto, Canada.
“I helped to organise Dove Day 2018 for Canada and participated in workshops at two schools that day.
“It was a wonderful experience to go out and spend time with young people and help guide them through the challenges that self-esteem and body confidence can cause.
“Children are very smart and are full of confidence at a young age, but over time that fades and this is something I don’t want to see happen. I believe it’s so important to try to keep that childhood confidence alive.
“There are too many sources of pressure and anxiety that young women can face today. Unless she has people in her life supporting her and helping to build up her self-esteem it can be very easy for a girl to succumb to the pressures.”
Mallu, Brazil
Mallu joined a World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts delegation to visit London. Supported by Dove, girls had the chance to attend workshops designed to boost body confidence and communication skills.
“I’ve learned to believe more in myself, to be proud of me.
“You have to like yourself and see your importance. You have to smile when you see yourself in the mirror. And only you can make other people see it. Realise it.
“Now more than ever I want to help other people think about it. I am sure that our little steps make big differences.
“I have care and love for me that I didn’t have before.”
Mendy Indigo, Thailand

Angeli, Philippines
Girl Scout Angeli is an advocate of the Free Being Me programme.
“I was 14 when I first attended a Dove self-esteem session in a national Girl Scout camp. I was able to confront insecurities and fears in my own body. The confidence that I gained helped me find that capacity to lead young people in my community as a government official.
“We went on to train adults and young women to share Free Being Me and in the last three years we reached more than 600,000 girls in the Philippines.
“Cultural change is a big challenge to overcome but for a girl who believes in herself, there ain’t no mountain high enough. Imagine millions of girls believe that they can make the world a better place to live, regardless of their size, race or colour. A future where girls and women can reach their full potential.”
Maca, Argentina
Maca is a professional footballer, currently signed to San Lorenzo.
In a country where football is extremely male dominated and often sexist, Maca stands up for women’s rights in sport.
As a professional Argentinean football player, she uses her platform to speak out about work conditions for women within the sports industry, and questions the huge gap between men and women in terms of salary.
Laura, UK
Laura is a lead volunteer of a Girl Guiding peer education programme and helped deliver Dove’s Free Being Me training to hundreds of girls in the UK and Ireland.
“For years I’ve wanted to make the lives of girls and young women better, allowing them to be who they truly are and with confidence to achieve.
“Creating a body confident society requires all to get on board – body confidence won’t succeed without you. Voice what you love about your body, the great things it can do, the unique aspects which make you, you. If we don’t act together, low self-esteem will continue to cripple society and no one will achieve what they are capable of.
“With confidence, passion and persistence I’m going to try to make that change help others be who they truly are. If you don’t change the world, who will? Don’t leave it to chance that the world will turn out the way you want. Take action. Create motion. Change the world.”
Karis, Hong Kong
Karis is a long-term member of Girl Guiding and a peer educator for Dove’s Free Being Me programme in Hong Kong.
“Girl Guides aims to help girls to develop their talents and build up their self-confidence. Building up their body confidence is one of the ways to improve their confidence overall. When girls have body confidence, they show their talents and try new things. They develop their unique personality.
“Having body confidence can help girls to live their own way, free from the culture of ‘Beauty = Confidence’ built by society.
“Free Being Me changed my mind – and I now know that beauty is not measured by the person’s appearance. A girl looks beautiful because of her confidence. When a girl is showing her confidence, she looks unique.”

text About the author
Vicky Murray has been Sustainability Manager at Pukka Herbs since 2015. Her
previous roles range from mapping coral reefs destroyed by dynamite fishing for
WWF to shaping sustainability strategies with Forum for the Future. Vicky is
based at Pukka’s Herb House HQ near Bristol in the UK.
Pukka is so much more than pretty packaging. Some people might choose us because our packs are beautiful. People keep buying us because our products make them feel great. And when they find out more about what we do behind the scenes, that’s when they really fall in love.
Pukka is a certified B Corp, and we invest 1% of our sales – not just our profit – in environmental causes and charities around the world. Like everyone here, I love the fact that we are part of a movement and driven by a mission. I’m proud that we’ve improved our B Corp impact scores year-on-year and have just been awarded ‘Changemakers – Best for the World’ in this year’s B Corp awards. Hopefully, we’re demonstrating that business can be a force for good.
We’ve mapped the carbon impact Pukka has on the planet, collecting data on everything we do from crop to cup. It means we’ve been able to work out how to keep our carbon footprint small and getting smaller. We’ve even set a science-based carbon reduction target, which was validated by the Science Based Target initiative at the end of last year.
We learned that 50% of our carbon emissions come from people boiling their kettles to make our tea. Next time you click yours on, please make sure you’re only boiling as much water as you intend to use. It’s the easiest way to reduce wasted energy. Even better, switch your power to renewable energy.
Our brand brings together so much around health and wellbeing. It combines ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, 100% organic ingredients and we are working with leading universities on ground-breaking herbal research. By demanding sustainability throughout our supply chain, we’re able to make a real impact on the lives of people who grow our ingredients too.
Our suppliers are what inspire me the most about working for Pukka. Without our organic practitioner-grade herbs, we’re nothing. But in a world where the climate crisis is making weather and conditions unpredictable and extreme, our farmers are facing enormous challenges.
On a recent visit to our aloe vera growers in Mexico, we found they’d had their first-ever frost. Aloe vera isn’t a plant that can tolerate low temperatures, but until now that’s never been an issue in Mexico. Elsewhere in the world, farmers are facing problems such as water shortages and floods too. We’re helping them to use techniques like better composting and agroforestry to build resilience.
As part of our work to support our farmers, we’ve become one of the world’s biggest buyers of FairWild-certified ingredients. FairWild collectors commit to not over-harvesting a plant, so that it can regenerate naturally, safeguarding its future. We pay collectors a premium price for their work, plus an amount to support projects benefiting the local community.
Without FairWild, these collectors would often be marginalised. Their work tends to be seasonal, casual labour, and the skills are passed down through families. Such communities need protecting and FairWild is a great way to ensure they have a steady, fair income.
“By launching a FairWild partnership with local growers, we have been able to provide them with a sustainable income to harvest bibhitaki fruit, protect the trees, and ensure the hornbills’ home is safe.” 
One of our FairWild crops is the bibhitaki fruit, used in our Triphala Formula. The bibhitaki tree is one of the only trees large enough to provide a home for nesting Great Pied Hornbills, beautiful birds which mate for life in India’s Western Ghats region. These majestic trees are under threat as they produce valuable timber. But by launching a FairWild partnership with local growers, we have been able to provide them with a sustainable income to harvest the fruit, protect the trees, and ensure the hornbills’ home is safe.
In Europe, we source elderflower for our Love Tea from Bosnian villages that were devastated by the war in the 1990s. Elder trees have flourished in the ruins, and our FairWild partnership was established to create employment for people who lost everything in the conflict. Now more than 700 families there collect a range of wild herbs, using practices that are fair and sustainable.
Meanwhile, our fennel comes from Turkey and the organic farming we do means the fields are buzzing with life. Biodiversity has had a chance to flourish without the use of pesticides. And on the other side of the world, our green tea comes from trees high in the mountains of Vietnam, where it’s hand-picked by workers and carried down in baskets on their backs.
We want to connect people to the power of plants and to do that, we have just introduced Pukka’s three-year Regenerative Strategy. One part of that strategy is supporting our farmers to build resilience in our supply chain. Another is about sharing what we’re doing so we can encourage other businesses to become a bit more Pukka. And the third element is about a herbal health revolution, and how we see wellbeing as a way to address the crisis around human health.
People are living longer but they’re not necessarily healthier. We urgently need to explore alternatives to antibiotics, and we must ease the strain on healthcare providers by preventing illness and helping aid quick recovery. We believe plants have a role to play in that.
It makes sense that plants can support our health and wellbeing, and we’re gathering research to explore the potential of some amazing ingredients. Sebastian Pole, one of our co-founders, is an Ayurvedic practitioner and a plant-powered holistic approach is what our business was built on.
We’ve got some very cool trials underway, exploring how herbs and plants can make a positive impact on everything from colds to stress. We’re working with some brilliant research partners and universities, and I can’t wait to see the results.

text 10% growth in 2020. 11% in 2021. 15% in the first quarter of 2022. One thousand products sold globally every minute.
These are just some of the statistics that have made Hellmann’s not only the world’s No.1 mayonnaise but also one of Unilever’s best-performing brands.
So what is driving this growth? Is it product? Purpose? Innovation?
For Hanneke Faber, President, Unilever Foods & Refreshment, the secret to Hellmann’s growing success story is anchored in ‘all of the above’.
“Hellmann’s is a great example of purpose accelerating growth when it complements a superior product,” she says.“Hellmann’s wins on taste among consumers and on being better for our planet. For example, it is the only leading Dressings brand in North America and Europe that uses 100% recycled plastic packaging, and 100% cage-free or free-range eggs.
“In addition, Hellmann’s purpose – fighting food waste – has grown brand power, and brand power drives market share and in turn growth,” Hanneke continues. “But purpose is the icing on the cake, it’s not the cake itself.”
And success depends on choosing the right icing. “Brands must find their purpose by staying true to their product truth and category benefits. Only then can they take action and speak up on the issues that matter to their consumers,” she explains.
Hellmann’s is a great example of purpose accelerating growth when it complements a fantastic quality product, outstanding innovations, the right channels and the right value.
Hanneke Faber, President, Unilever Foods & Refreshment
Leading the fight against household food waste
60%of all food waste happens in the home
From high-profile Super Bowl ads to creating online recipe resources to help home cooks make the most of the leftover food in their fridges, Hellmann’s mission to end food waste is a shining example of a perfect product–purpose match. 
Having helped people turn even the simplest ingredients into delicious meals for over a century, and as the world’s No.1 bestselling mayonnaise available in 65 countries, the brand has both the authority and the reach to drive change at scale.
“We know nobody sets out to throw good food away – food waste is an unintended outcome of people lacking the confidence, time or skills to make the most of the food they have on hand,” says Christina Bauer-Plank, Global Vice President of Hellmann’s and Dressings.
“Globally, one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted (FAO) and with 61% of food waste occurring in the home (WEF), we knew it was there that we needed to direct our action,” she adds.
Using science to power behaviour change
To this end, Hellmann’s has set its mission to inspire and enable 100 million people around the world every year to be more resourceful with their food so that they waste less as part of Unilever’s larger commitment to help achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030.
In 2020 and 2021, the brand partnered with behavioral scientists BEworks and other leading global experts to conduct one of the longest and largest consumer behaviour intervention studies on household food waste.
“We embarked on an ambitious study to uncover simple solutions that people could use at home to reduce their food waste – without sacrificing the enjoyment that comes from preparing a quick and tasty meal,” explains Christina. “We have used our learnings to shape a series of programmes aimed at helping people be more resourceful with the food they have in their home.” (See the case studies below.)

Christina Bauer-Plank, VP, Hellmann’s
The power of purpose
46%reduction of household food waste over a four-week period
The results are impressive. In both Canada and the US, the pilot studies of Hellmann’s behaviour change programmes showed that simple interventions like adopting a weekly Use-Up Day, or using Hellmann’s Flexipes (flexible recipes aimed at using up the most wasted ingredients) led to up to a 46% reduction of household food waste over a four-week period.
In 2021 alone, Hellmann’s Make Taste Not Waste campaign inspired more than 200 million people across the US, Canada and the UK to waste less food. In 2022 the brand returned to the Super Bowl to continue to drive awareness and make an impact on the important issue of food waste during one of America’s largest food holidays. This is all compelling evidence that Hellmann’s is probably the biggest voice in the world speaking to consumers about food waste.
“The success that we have achieved with our programmes, combined with our double-digit growth, provides a compelling argument that doing good supports business growth,” concludes Christina. The marketing consultancy, Kantar supports her view. Brands recognised for their commitment to purpose, it says, have grown at twice the rate of others.
Hanneke Faber recognises that other factors have also fed into Hellmann’s rising growth figures. Product innovation has played a critical role, particularly as regards the growing market demand for plant-based alternatives.
Powered by a variety of concerns, including health, the environment and animal welfare, the plant-based food trend is increasingly shaping the market, with Bloomberg Intelligence predicting that it could swell to $162 billion in the next decade from $29.4 billion in 2020.
Thanks to the dedicated teams researching plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy at Unilever’s food research centre Hive in Wageningen, Unilever is well positioned to make the most of this growing market. One of its recent success stories is Hellmann’s Vegan Mayo.Since its launch in 2016, it has become the leading vegan mayonnaise in many markets, with sales doubling year after year.
“As part of our Future Foods commitments, we have pledged to deliver more plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, and Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise is testimony to the fact that this can be achieved without sacrificing taste,” says Hanneke. “It is just one example of the advantages of having a future fit portfolio that supports consumers’ needs for their own health as well as the health of the planet.”
A question of taste
Christina Bauer-Plank is quick to point out, however, that no amount of brand awareness or product innovation could drive growth if the product failed to meet up to consumers’ taste expectations. Research shows that Hellmann’s products are repeatedly preferred by consumers for their unmistakable taste and creaminess and the fact that they are made with sustainable ingredients and in recyclable packaging.
“People accept that eating a plant-based diet is better for our health and the health of the planet, but the key barrier to their making the switch is taste. This was why our priority was to make a vegan mayo that would surprise consumers by having the same great taste, just 100% plant based,” she says.
UK market consumer reviews indicate that they have succeeded… perhaps even enough to challenge the blue ribbon original. “People are rating Hellmann’s Vegan to be perhaps the best mayo we have ever made,” says Christina. “We cannot ask for more than that.”
text We have been working towards 100% renewable electricity as a global goal for 2020, but have achieved five continents ahead of time.
As far as possible, our transition to renewable electricity has been delivered through supporting the development of local renewable energy markets, with 38% of our grid electricity supplied through a combination of corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green electricity tariffs.
Where this has not been feasible, we have purchased Renewable Electricity Certificates (RECs). A REC is an openly traded certificate which states that one party has generated renewable electricity and then sold it to another party, who 'retires' the REC to show they’ve used it.
This announcement comes at an opportune moment. On 23 September, we’ll be taking to the stage at the opening ceremony of Climate Week NYC and participating in the UN Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit. Here we’ll join leaders from government and business in advocating for the importance of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5°C – in line with the Paris Agreement.
Aiming to become carbon neutral
Reaching 100% renewable electricity across five continents is a significant step towards our target to become a carbon neutral company before 2030.
As part of our efforts to reach that goal, we have been working with partners around the world to generate renewable electricity at our own sites, with solar power currently in use at Unilever facilities in 18 countries. In fact, we now have 16 manufacturing sites that are completely carbon neutral in their energy use.
Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer at Unilever, says: “The climate emergency is one of the most urgent challenges we’re all facing. Our teams have worked hard to secure renewable energy contracts for our sites across five continents, accelerating the delivery of our 100% renewable energy targets.
“Of course, there is more work to do. But we hope that today’s announcement will inspire further action elsewhere and help to prove that it is possible to combat the climate crisis and hold global warming at 1.5° Celsius. Renewable is doable.”
A big contributor to today’s announcement is our investment in energy efficiency programmes – which have led to a reduction in total energy consumption of 28% – and to the halving of carbon emissions per tonne of production since 2008. This has also helped to achieve over €600 million in cumulative cost avoidance.
Of course, there is more work to do, but we hope that today’s announcement will inspire further action elsewhere and help to prove that it is possible to combat the climate crisis. Marc Engel, Unilever’s Chief Supply Chain Officer 
Carbon pricing as a way of boosting investment
One way we are boosting investment in renewable energy is through internal carbon pricing. We put a price of €40 on each tonne of carbon emissions and use the proceeds to reinvest into projects that can cut climate impacts. Since we set this up in June 2016, the ‘tax’ has raised over €120 million for us to spend on renewable energy at our manufacturing sites.
Carbon pricing is a fundamental part of tackling climate change. Factoring in a cost to investment decisions helps identify climate-related risks and opportunities. It prepares for a time when government levies are the norm. It encourages innovation and a shift to low- or zero-carbon alternatives. And it helps build resilience into supply chains.
Part of wider industry efforts
Outside our own operations, we participate in a number of alliances and initiatives that aim to progress wider industry efforts on climate action.
For instance, we support the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign #OurOnlyFuture – launched ahead of this month’s Climate Action Summit – which calls on businesses to set science-based targets in line with the Paris Agreement. In fact, we were recently recognised by the United Nations Global Compact for being one of first businesses to commit to such targets.
We are a member of the RE100 global campaign, a collaborative initiative bringing together more than 190 of the world’s most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable power. As RE100 members operate across a diverse range of sectors, together they send a powerful signal to policymakers and investors to accelerate the transition to a clean economy.
Sam Kimmins, Head of RE100 at the Climate Group, says: “Though membership of RE100, global companies like Unilever are sending a strong demand signal to the few markets where renewables remain harder to access. They want to be able to source renewable electricity locally at an affordable price – and they want to do that now.”
We have also worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development to share best practice in the development of Power Purchase Agreements.

text Food is one of our basic requirements for life. It takes centre stage in family rituals and celebrations and is the star of many of the world’s most popular Instagram feeds. Yet every year one-third of the total amount the world produces – around 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted.
That, says the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is not just a misuse of the world’s natural resources, it’s also a huge part of our carbon footprint – 8% of global emissions to be precise.
According to Project Drawdown, which champions the 100 most impactful solutions to reduce global warming, reducing food waste is No.3 on the hit list. “If 50% of food waste is reduced by 2050, avoided emissions could be equal to 26.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide,” the Project says.
And that’s just for starters. “Reducing waste also avoids the deforestation for additional farmland, preventing 44.4 gigatons of additional emissions.”
Achieving the ambition of cutting food waste depends on action across all parts of the food supply chain: reducing emissions from agriculture, revisiting purchase patterns and redistributing food before it is wasted.
It’s an issue that Unilever’s Foods and Refreshment team are putting front and centre, covering product development, Unilever Food Solutions’ work with the restaurants around the world and the way consumers can rely on some of our most popular brands, such as Hellmann’s, for help in using leftovers and unloved ingredients in imaginative and tasty ways.
Here are just eight of the ways we’re rethinking food waste from product to plate:
The vegan mayonnaise made from unwanted bean water
Once, the leftover liquid from an open can of chickpeas was simply wasted. Not any more. The gloopy liquid called ‘aquafaba’ is the ‘secret sauce’ in New York-based condiment firm, Sir Kensington’s, vegan mayonnaise. The liquid can be whipped into white peaks in the same way as egg whites.
This has made it a hit with the vegan community as an egg substitute and has also seen it put to use to provide the great texture of Sir Kensington’s vegan alternative to mayonnaise, Fabanaise. Thanks to the company’s initial partnership with food firm Ithaca Hummus, tens of thousands of pounds of aquafaba has been saved from the drain and it is now a key ingredient in this loved product.
The brewing by-product that’s a toast topper the world over
Marmite is a brown pungent yeast spread that is loved and hated by consumers in equal measure. Produced in the brewing town of Burton upon Trent in the UK, its recipe has remained unchanged for more than 100 years.
Alongside the salt, vegetable juice concentrates, vitamins and natural celery flavouring, 90% of a local brewing company’s waste yeast is used as an ingredient in the spread. And it doesn’t end there. By-products from Marmite’s own production are put to good use too. Part of the yeast by-product is used for animal feed; other waste is sent for anaerobic digestion which generates biogas, used to power the factory.
The green tomatoes that created a fresh new ketchup taste
The main ingredient in ketchup is red, not green tomatoes. Come harvest, only red tomatoes are processed, while more than 10% of the global tomato crop is wasted simply because it’s not red enough. 
“No one likes to see perfectly good food go to waste,” says Hellmann’s Brand Manager, Rhiannon Lines. After discussion with its Spanish tomato supplier, Agraz, Hellmann’s decided to see what would happen if every tomato was processed. The result is Hellmann’s Ketchup Made with Red and Green Tomatoes, blended with herbs and spices to create a fresh new taste. It’s saved up to 2.5 million tomatoes a year. “With every squeeze, consumers are doing their bit to keep perfectly good tomatoes from going uneaten,” Rhiannon says.
The app offering meal plan ideas to reduce restaurant waste
Each time a guest eats at a restaurant, they create 0.5 kilos of waste – 30% comes from what’s left on their plate and 70% is produced in the kitchen. As well as the economic cost, every tonne of food wasted costs a business £1,800 (€1,950) and there’s a significant social and environmental impact.
To help professional kitchens reduce the amount of food wasted, Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) created the Wise Up on Waste app. It identifies what part of food prep and which meals generate the most wastage and offers creative uses for leftovers. More than 160 companies have registered to use it. It’s been downloaded 6,000 times and recognised by the Guardian newspaper as a top ten sustainability app.
The ANZ Food Collective that redirects unwanted meals to charities
The Waste and Reduction Action Programme (WRAP) estimates that one in every six out of home meals is thrown away. In a bid to rescue food within the Australian and New Zealand hospitality industry, Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) has teamed up with three charities, OzHarvest, KiwiHarvest and Kaibosh, to create The Food Collective, which rescues unwanted restaurant food and ingredients and distributes them to people in need.
To date, 110,000 meals have been redirected by these charities, saving people from going hungry and ensuring food goes to nourish people rather than heading to landfill. What’s more, for every case of UFS products purchased, 0.5 cent is donated to the charities, 0.5 cent equating to one meal for people in need.
The Greek hotels engaging staff and guests to cut waste
Piled high plates of fruit, cheeses, meats and breads all add to the luxury of a hotel buffet. Yet research reveals just over 50% is consumed. It’s this wastage that Unilever Food Solutions/WWF and three Greek hotels are working to change. The Grecotel Cape Sounio, Aquila Rithymna Beach, and Athens Marriott Hotel are currently taking part in a three-month pilot programme called WWF Hotel Kitchen: Here we value food.
It includes the implementation of food waste measures in the kitchen as well as informing staff and guests about their role in the responsible consumption of food. When the programme was first implemented in the US, food waste was reduced by 17%. The three Greek hotels hope for similar results.
The restaurants that turned leftover ingredients into five-star dishes
We can all relate to that moment when you look in the fridge and think there is nothing to eat. It’s called ‘fridge blindness’ and contributes to the 40% of food waste that happens at the household level. To tackle this issue, Hellmann’s launched the Bring Your Own Food restaurant in São Paulo and Prague to inspire people to turn leftover ingredients into delicious meals. Celebrity chefs turned these ingredients into five-star meals using Hellmann’s.
Instead of a bill, diners received a recipe of the ingredients used. Every dish became a recipe video and proved that Hellmann’s can make a delicious meal out of seemingly uninspiring ingredients and that food is too good to be wasted.
The brand that fed a stadium with rescued food
Every minute, enough food is wasted in Canada to feed a stadium. So Hellmann’s rescued food from local suppliers and turned it into delicious meals that were fed to an entire stadium free of charge. In a big screen reveal, the audience was made aware that the food they enjoyed was rescued.
They then learnt that Hellmann’s is partnering with MLSE (Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment) and will collect the leftover food from stadium events and redistribute it to those in need, pledging to donate 50,000 meals. The video highlights the huge problem and provides a call to action to visit the brand’s site where consumers can get more information and ideas on how to reduce their own waste.
text It’s been three years since we announced our pledge to unstereotype our advertising. Since then we’ve been working on doing so across every brand and in every one of our markets.
We believe that reflecting a progressive and inclusive world can contribute to positive cultural change as well as deliver bottom-line results. The latest data from data and insights company Kantar tells us that unstereotypical advertising creates 37% more branded impact, 28% uplift in purchase intent and increases enjoyment of ads by 35%.
That’s why we’ve been working with creatives to ensure our campaigns defy outdated and harmful cultural norms and instead are underpinned by inclusive, diverse and progressive portrayals of people to inspire, support and empower the audiences we reach.
Science against stereotyping
Earlier this year, we worked with academics at University College London on an experiment which challenged our marketers to rethink the way their campaigns portray the people we serve.
More than 60 advertising and marketing professionals from Unilever and our key agency partners in London, New York and Rotterdam volunteered to provide a DNA sample which was used to examine their geographical origins.
Following their results, the volunteers took part in a behaviour-change workshop with UCL designed to create a deeper understanding of how and when stereotypes are learnt, the brain mechanisms that govern them and how we can unlearn stereotypical thought patterns to increase creative and inclusive thinking.
The Unstereotype Experiment showed a statistically significant 35% reduction in stereotypical thinking and a significant change in original thinking among those who took part.
“Becoming conscious of our blind spots”
“Taking people on a journey through their own DNA profile created a moment of reappraisal and, in many cases, that realisation of their ancestry proved to be a great surprise to them,” explains Associate Professor of Experimental Psychology Dr Lasana Harris.
“Coupled with training on how the brain forms stereotypes, we challenged their perception of themselves and, in turn, that of others.”
Aline Santos, EVP of Global Marketing and Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, adds: “We are constantly innovating to find new ways to accelerate Unstereotype across our workforce and in our advertising. Becoming conscious of our blind spots and the biases that are holding us back is fundamental, but unconscious bias training has its limitations.
“We’ve piloted this experimental approach and measured its impact because disruptive techniques and scientific methods will help us all to drive the action needed to be more progressive in our creative work.”

text As we celebrate Global Handwashing Day this year with millions of people across the globe, we’re thrilled to share the news that Lifebuoy has improved the handwashing behaviours of 1 billion people.
That was originally our target for 2020, so we’re delighted to have achieved it a year ahead of time.
What started as a simple handwashing programme in three countries a decade ago has evolved into a fully-fledged mission to prevent illnesses globally.
We’re currently working with more than 20 partners in 30 countries to encourage the most vulnerable in our society to adopt good handwashing habits.
Our school programme makes handwashing with soap fun and rewarding. It spreads hygiene messages in an engaging way to schoolchildren and their parents.
Our programme for mothers gives them the knowledge and information to help ensure that their children fall ill a little less often.
We partner with world leaders, governments, NGOs, charities and celebrities to advocate for the cause of handwashing and turn the Sustainable Development Goal related to hygiene – SDG 6 – into practice at a global, regional and local level.
This year, for the first time, we’re also enlisting the help of influencers to amplify the message further. These include cricket star Shakib Al Hasan in Bangladesh, popular actors Titi and Tian in Indonesia, and Help A Child Reach 5 ambassador Kajol Devgan in India.
We have achieved the milestone of reaching 1 billion people ahead of schedule, but we’re not stopping there. In fact, we already have our sights set firmly on the next billion.
“Lifebuoy has become a world-class brand that’s known for turning our expertise on behaviour change into teaching children and mothers to wash their hands with soap and create lifelong, life-saving habits,” explains Lifebuoy’s Global Brand VP Kartik Chandrasekhar.
“Changing habits is difficult, as any of us who have tried to start exercising or a new diet would know. That’s where a brand like Lifebuoy – the world’s biggest health soap, and part of Unilever, whose products are used by two billion people around the world on any given day – can really help.”

Saving lives is at the heart of our heritage
In 1894, during the Industrial Revolution, Unilever founder William Lever created Lifebuoy to combat the rampant disease and infections that ran rife in UK factory towns during a period of rapid urbanisation.
In 1894, during the Industrial Revolution, Unilever founder William Lever created Lifebuoy to combat the rampant disease and infections that ran rife in UK factory towns during a period of rapid urbanisation.
It was Lever’s horror at the high infant mortality rates and the experience of being surrounded by the squalid, unsanitary conditions of 19th-century Britain that made him determined to find the perfect germ-fighting formula and maintain a low price so that his soap was available to everyone.
What he did in the process was not only create one of the world’s first consumer brands but also an agent of social change.
That heritage of saving lives and helping to drive social change has remained at the heart of Lifebuoy’s purpose to this day.
We must do more… and here’s how you can help
Globally, over 1.2 million children under the age of five die from preventable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea each year. To put that another way, every 30 seconds a child is deprived of their future. Yet, this could be prevented through the simple act of handwashing with soap.
As a brand that exists to save lives and prevent illnesses, we can and must do more. This Global Handwashing Day, we invite you to join our quest to reach the next billion people with hygiene messages.
Give back to your local community by volunteering your time to teach children healthy handwashing habits; this keeps preventable diseases at bay and helps children to thrive and realise their potential.
text Cheap, flexible and multipurpose plastic has become the ubiquitous material of today’s fast-moving economy. Modern society would be lost without it.
But our ‘take-make-dispose’ approach to consumption means that most packaging rarely gets used a second time. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, around 95% of the value of plastic packaging is lost to the economy after one short use.
It’s unsustainable.
As a business, we’re acutely aware of the causes and consequences of this model. And we are working hard to change it.
One way we’re doing that is by exploring different options around refill and reuse.
The benefits
Reducing the need for plastic is clearly good for the environment. The urgency to act on plastic pollution is now widely understood and many large organisations – including Unilever – are committed to creating a circular economy for plastic. Recycling is important, but it’s just one component. Refillable and reusable could well be the gamechanger we need.
At the same time, consumers are increasingly demanding more eco-friendly packaging and a reduction in plastic. Preferences are also shifting to more sophisticated packaging, including higher quality and even personalised. Innovative reuse models can tap into these shifting trends by, for example, delivering better-looking, more functional packaging that allows customisation.
This, in turn, presents a business opportunity. Through more convenient models and more attractive packaging, we can deliver a superior user experience and build brand loyalty. It can also help save costs, particularly in terms of transportation.
According to a new report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (PDF 17.15 MB), replacing just 20% of single-use plastic packaging with reusable alternatives offers an opportunity worth at least $10 billion.
A few of the initiatives we’re working on
Here are some examples of the trials we’re currently running. Success is very dependent on consumers changing their behaviour and that’s something we can’t control. But we’ll continue to test, learn and refine so we can deliver a range of solutions that work.
Cif ecorefill is a new technology that allows consumers to refill and reuse their Cif spray bottles for life. 
At the beginning of this year, nine of our brands started trialling reusable packaging innovations on LOOP, a global, first-of-its-kind, waste-free shopping system. 
In Chile, we’re partnering with Algramo to pilot an app-powered, intelligent dispensing system that uses electric tricycles to deliver to people’s homes. 
A pilot from All Things Hair – our content platform for hair inspiration and advice – brought a whole new model of eco-friendly shopping to consumers in the Philippines. 
In Brazil, the concept of a concentrated product where you only need a much smaller dose than normal has never really taken off. 
The challenges
There are several ways in which refill-reuse models could work. You can fill up your container at home using refills you buy at a shop or online. You can use an in-store dispensing machine at a large supermarket. You can get your empty containers picked up from home, replenished and delivered back. Or you can return packaging at a store or drop-off point, as part of a deposit-return scheme.
While different options will suit different people and different circumstances, they all pose their own challenges.
From a business perspective, there are various considerations. For example, putting a dispensing machine in a shop or picking up empty packaging to wash, refill and return requires very different distribution and logistics operations that, to work, need to be efficient and economically viable.
Deposit and reward schemes must be carefully thought through to ensure they incentivise the return of packaging without putting consumers off with a high initial deposit. And if we want consumers to return bottles, we need to make sure there are enough drop-off points in the right locations.
But even if business gets this side of the equation sorted, we can’t force consumers to buy into the idea. That's why we need to work with others on this transition. It requires people to change often long-held habits in terms of how they both shop and consume.
Will consumers think it’s too much hassle to clean their containers and take them to a shop to refill them? It’s becoming the norm for us to carry refillable water bottles, but is it a step too far to lug big laundry bottles back and forth?
Will they be tempted by smaller, less impressive looking refill packs that sit alongside full-sized products on the supermarket shelf?
Will they trust that a concentrated refill diluted with water at home really does have the same cleaning power?
As Richard Slater, Unilever’s Chief R&D Officer, explains: “This is a really exciting area and one where we’re aiming to take a leading role. While we’ve been designing potential solutions and experimenting for some time, it’s a new and very different concept for consumers.
“We’re trailing various approaches to tackle the issue, as there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution. We’re determined to make a real difference on the plastics challenge, and so we’ll continue to experiment and to test, learn and refine.”
Closing the loop
The other thing to remember is that this won’t necessarily get rid of plastic completely. Plastic is still involved in some way in most models – in the small refill bottles or the bulk dispensing containers in-store. Plus of course, for the most part, the initial reusable container is made from plastic.
What’s important is that these models – if designed and implemented correctly – will dramatically reduce the amount of plastic in circulation. Plus, to really ‘close the loop’, we need to make sure that most, if not all, the various elements are themselves widely recyclable.
text Food sustains life and is readily available in most parts of the world today. Yet major challenges lie ahead. Not only is the global population expected to increase by around two billion people by 2050, but climate change could well reduce the land available for food production.
Plant-based diets: a necessary shift
Discussing the foods we eat and how we grow them is therefore increasingly important.
“Such a conversation is not just about food security”, says April Redmond, Global VP at Knorr, one of our biggest brands. “The nutritious value of future savoury foods is critical as well. Our ambition is to make it easier for people to eat a wide variety of foods that are good for us, good for the planet and, of course, delicious at the same time.”
Many ways exist to meet this goal, but to diversify our diets sustainably will mean consuming more savoury plant-based foods and less meat.
Why? Land, for one. Hectare by hectare, growing plants is significantly more efficient than meat production. Just 18% of all the calories we consume and 37% of all protein comes from meat and dairy, respectively, yet between them they occupy 83% of global farmland.
There are also the benefits for human health to consider. Plant-based foods – such as pulses, wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices – can provide all the nutrients we need to live active, healthy lives.
Plant-based foods: tasty and timely
Worldwide, more and more people are shifting to flexitarian diets – generally understood as largely plant-based with occasional meat. This is a great opportunity for Unilever. We can help people develop healthier diets and together work on a healthier planet, while also growing our business.
We want to work with others to help develop ‘plant-forward foods’, to borrow the phrase of global nutritionists and environmentalists. That’s one of the reasons we recently signed up to the One Planet Business for Biodiversity coalition, which includes a strong focus on plant-based diets.
Yet, we also recognise that if we are going to consume billions of nutritious plant-based meals, then today’s food system needs to change radically.
The most urgent issue is the diversification of food supply. Globally, we rely on a tiny range of foods at present. It’s incredible to think that, while there are more than 20,000 known edible plants on our planet, three-quarters of our diets come from just 12 plant and five animal species.
Changing consumer behaviour is critical. While vegetarian diets dominate in some countries (such as India), meat consumption occupies a central place in most gastronomic cultures. Altering attitudes towards food is no easy task. Yet with education and motivation – plus a large helping of culinary creativity – change is possible.
The only way to persuade people to part company with meat is if 'meat' from plants is at least as tasty as real meat. Jaap Korteweg, founder of The Vegetarian Butcher 
Promoting plant-forward: products, variants and cooking
Building demand marks an obvious starting point. Many reasons exist for consumers to modify their diets, yet the most compelling by far is that they like what they see on the supermarket shelves and when eating out of home. With that in mind, our brands are working with cutting-edge food scientists to develop a host of super tasty, nutritious plant-based products that can act as alternatives.
For example, plant-based innovations like Magnum Vegan, the Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy range, as well as Hellmann’s Vegan Mayo variant, have all been very well received by consumers across the globe.
Some of the most inventive are the products created by The Vegetarian Butcher. The brand’s founder – Jaap Korteweg, a ninth-generation farmer – worked with scientists, leading chefs, butchers and trendsetters to come up with his new ‘meat’.
“The only way to persuade people to part company with meat is if 'meat' from plants is at least as tasty as real meat. Of course, it helps that it's also healthier and better for the climate, nature, animals and global food supplies,” says Jaap.
His message is clearly hitting home. From its humble beginnings, the Dutch brand has mushroomed over the last few years and now counts 3,000 sales outlets in 14 countries.
Our chefs working to help more chefs
We’re working on many fronts to shift consumer behaviour and get people excited about eating more plant-based foods. At Unilever Food Solutions (UFS), our dedicated foodservice business, we are improving our plant-based range as well as working with chefs on how to use these in their kitchens and on their menus.
For example, earlier this year, Knorr and environmental charity WWF-UK co-released a 60-page booklet which highlights Future 50 Foods that are nutrient-rich and have a low environmental impact. The selection balances old favourites, like walnuts and broad beans, alongside less common foodstuffs, such as cacti and black salsify (a parsnip-like root vegetable).
Knorr chefs also created a variety of exciting, easy-to-make recipes based on the Future 50 Foods, which it is promoting online and in-store. Knorr is also developing innovative partnerships to accelerate consumption of the nutritious foods on its list.
A case in point is our close collaboration with the international food services company Sodexo. Sodexo and Knorr Professional chefs and nutritionists have developed 40 recipes using ingredients from the report, which Sodexo is now rolling out across its kitchens. The campaign kicked off in September with 5,000 locations in the UK, US, Belgium and France.
A more diverse palette of plant-based ingredients makes cooking more exciting, food more nutritious and agricultural practices more sustainable. Ria van der Maas, UFS Global Nutritionist 
Chefs’ Manifesto: promoting plant-forward cooking
As the bridge between the farm and the fork, professional chefs are instrumental in determining what we put on our plates when at home, as well as what we eat when we dine out.
Given their ripple effect, we became active supporters and a contributor to the Chefs’ Manifesto. Written by chefs, for chefs, the Manifesto explores how professional chefs can contribute to achieving zero hunger, as laid out in SDG 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals. With biodiversity as a central issue, it calls on chefs around the world to champion food biodiversity in their kitchens and recipes for a more diverse, sustainable and delicious future. A practical Action Plan outlines simple steps that chefs can take in their kitchens, classrooms and communities to deliver a better food system for all.
“A more diverse palette of plant-based ingredients makes cooking more exciting, food more nutritious and agricultural practices more sustainable. And chefs can really do what they love: create new and exciting dishes”, says Ria van der Maas, UFS Global Nutritionist.
text How it started
It could be argued that the Dirt Is Good, or DIG as it is known, success story started in 1909 with the launch of Persil – the world’s first commercial laundry detergent.
But in real terms, the DIG story really begins nearly a century later, when in 2008 the decision was taken to unite the laundry brands within our portfolio (including OMO, Persil, Skip, Surf Excel, Rinso and Breeze) under the Dirt Is Good brand.
The move pioneered a marketing approach that focused on the brand purpose, as well as its superior performance as the industry’s No.1 laundry detergent.
Fourteen years later, the Dirt Is Good tagline and the visual ‘Splat’ that accompanies it have become symbols of the brand’s purpose: to inspire children to explore and play safe in the knowledge that DIG products will get even the messiest clothes clean again.
How it’s going
Dirt Is Good is Unilever’s biggest laundry brand and one of the most recognisable around the world. It holds either first or second positions in all key markets and sells over 300 packs every few seconds. 
In fact, Unilever’s research found that 80% of British consumers asked to name any laundry detergent will say Persil first. In Brazil, OMO has been the No.1 recognised brand for the last 28 years – beating the likes of Coca-Cola, Nike and Apple, perhaps unsurprising for a federation of brands that hold the fourth-largest FMCG penetration in the world.
Finding solutions to real consumer pain-points has as always been at the heart of the brand’s innovation. Persil was, for example, the first to introduce tablets in 1989 and capsules in 2000. The Persil Small & Mighty range, the UK & Ireland’s first double concentrated liquid detergent, was launched in March 2007, followed by the Dual Action Capsules, the first capsules in the UK with built-in stain removers.
In 2020, as part of Unilever’s Clean Future commitment, the brand stepped up its efforts to address the climate crisis by rethinking the way products were created, manufactured and packaged so that they remained tough on stains but were kinder to the planet.
Among a range of initiatives, DIG introduced plant-based stain removers and cardboard packaging. It also cut its use of virgin plastic and pioneered ingredients made from waste industrial emissions (see ‘Pushing boundaries for cleaner capsules’, below). Together these initiatives won DIG two awards from WARC, the global marketing consultancy: a Gold in the Most Effective Purposeful Campaign category, and the Special Sustainability Award.
In 2022 there was a new breakthrough with the launch of DIG’s most sustainable capsule ever, featuring a new formula for high performance on a low-energy cold wash. The capsules are not only tough on stains but have also reduced manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions by 16% 1 while helping consumers save up to 60% energy per use at home.
The purpose that powers it
Since its creation in 2008, DIG has worked with parents, schools and external partners to promote outdoor play as a way for kids to learn and develop. The Dirt Is Good ethos is founded on the simple idea that by providing high-performance products that easily remove even the toughest stains, DIG is freeing children (and adults) to explore without worrying about getting messy.
The project was hugely successful, but by 2020 research revealed that DIG needed to pivot to address the evolving attitudes of both children and parents. As Lesley Thorne, Dirt Is Good Brand Equity Director, explains: “Child development is, as always, at the core of the brand, but that development is now more than ever about daring to take action on the issues and causes children believe in”.
Now through the Dirt Is Good project (live in the UK, Brazil, India, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Chile), the brand is working with NGOs, schools and communities to inspire 10 million young people to take action for the causes that matter to them.
Brand new ideas
Product: Pushing boundaries for cleaner capsules
In 2021 DIG piloted the world’s first laundry capsule made with industrial emissions. Surfactants are a key ingredient for creating the foam and cleaning action of laundry products, and to date are typically derived from fossil fuels. However, thanks to new technology from carbon recycling company LanzaTech and with India Glycols, a manufacturer of green technology-based chemicals, a surfactant was produced made from carbon emissions. Used in limited-edition OMO capsules launched in China, this innovation was a milestone, marking the first time that a surfactant made using captured carbon emissions had come onto the market in a cleaning product.
Campaign: Changing the conversation
As the first detergent to focus on purpose as well as performance, DIG has always been an advertising adventurer. Faced with the challenge of how to reach tech-centric kids who were losing touch with the outdoors, the team turned to Trojan Horse tactics - light-heartedly concealing the true aim of the campaign - and teamed up with LOLA/Golin London advertising agencies to create a fake game trailer for the real-life game of tag. Game visuals, messaging, music and gaming influencers with a combined reach of 10.2 million were all used to highlight the fact that in the end real-life games deliver the biggest adrenaline rush. The campaign deservedly won Bronze at the 2022 Cannes Lions. #TagTheGame

Packaging: Plastic free 
As part of its commitment to a more sustainable future, DIG has created plastic-free packaging for its laundry capsules. Made 50% from recycled cardboard and 50% from materials from Forest Stewardship Council-certified forests, 2 the new packaging ticks all the right boxes:
Reduces plastic: 6,000 tonnes a year: the equivalent in weight to 500 double-decker buses
Locks out moisture more effectively, thereby preventing capsules sticking together
Child proof
Easy to close
Fully recyclable.

text Vaseline has been a vital addition to bathroom cabinets, make-up bags and first-aid kits for 150 years – but age certainly isn’t slowing it down. In fact Vaseline is one of the fastest-growing brands in Unilever.
Beloved for its ability to gently soothe, smooth and heal skin, this enduring brand has come a long way since Brooklyn-based chemist Robert Chesebrough patented the process of making purified petroleum jelly. In his patent application, he mentioned that his product could be used to treat chapped hands and as a hair pomade. But Vaseline really took off when women began applying the affordable product to lashes, lips and skin – and evangelising about the results to their friends.
Fast-forward a century and a half and, once again, Vaseline is seeing a sustained surge in sales thanks in part to a new demographic of skincare enthusiasts extolling its virtues – this time on social media. A viral trend known as ‘slugging’, where beauty fans sleep with their face covered in Vaseline Jelly and wake to a radiant complexion, has inspired devotion among legions of Generation Z followers. In August 2022, the hashtag #Slugging had more than 415 million views on TikTok alone, with countless users celebrating the benefits of Vaseline’s glow-giving powers.
But beauty trends aren’t the only reason for Vaseline’s lasting popularity. Its longstanding purpose, premium product innovations, digital evolution and well-timed entry to new markets all add up to a winning formula – along with many years of affection.
Here are five factors behind Vaseline’s 15 decades of success…
150 years of brand love
Vaseline has been part of skincare routines for more than a century. What started with a little pot of skin-healing jelly has since expanded to a portfolio including lip balms, body lotions, deodorants, hand creams and more – all carrying the Vaseline name, and with it decades of trust from generations of users.
Now sold in more than 70 countries and a staple in millions of homes around the globe, Vaseline experienced a revival when Covid-19 hit. As consumers craved products they knew and loved, many shifted back to established, familiar brands with long-earned reputations for superior skincare.
Local and global growth
Vaseline started out in the United States, and that’s still the brand’s biggest market. It continues to grow there in double digits – and now its success is echoed all over the world.
On the other side of the globe in Asia, Vaseline has seen extremely strong results. It launched in India in 1947 and Thailand in the 1980s, and its performance in both countries outstripped forecasts last year. But China’s results are perhaps the most impressive. Vaseline relaunched there in 2015 and has posted very strong growth figures every year since. The country is now the brand’s second-biggest market worldwide.
In India, Vaseline took a strategic step in 2022 to extend its relevance beyond nourishing winter skincare by launching a summer range of body serums catering to the demand spaces of sun protection and brightening. With very light, non-sticky formulas designed for tropical heat conditions, the new products are performing well, positioning the brand for future growth.
Iconic products and premium lines
Vaseline is enjoying strong growth across its portfolio – from the iconic original Healing Jelly and ever-popular Intensive Care lotions to newer innovations.
The brand’s Pro Derma line is one such example, featuring cutting-edge technology developed in Unilever labs. Across the business, we have a team of Research & Development specialists, including over 200 PhDs, working on skincare science to ensure our brands deliver superior benefits.
A breakthrough innovation from our experts that’s been introduced to Vaseline is our Pro Derma technology. It allows skin-nourishing ingredients to penetrate deep into the epidermis to rebuild and restore ceramides – the ‘glue’ which regulates the skin’s natural barrier. Pro Derma is clinically proven to double the skin barrier’s strength from its first use.
Since launching the premium Pro Derma line in China, sales have rocketed and the range now accounts for 20% of Vaseline’s business in the country. Other advanced ingredients in the Pro Derma portfolio include niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, delivering on consumer demands.
Future-fit digital presence
Vaseline is stocked in supermarkets, small-scale retailers and chemists all over the world – but online sales have taken off significantly for the brand in recent years too, particularly in Asia.
India and Indonesia have both seen strong increases in online sales, and in China, digital commerce is the primary way Vaseline reaches and sells to consumers. The brand has launched successful partnerships with e-commerce giants Alibaba and Tmall and frequently works with influencers to demonstrate products and showcase superiority in a crowded beauty market.
The online slugging skincare trend, which shows no sign of abating, created a huge buzz for the brand and has led to the classic Vaseline Jelly tub being the brand’s highest-performing product in the past year. And by collaborating with influencers and digital creators to promote new product launches, Vaseline has connected with a large audience of young consumers, winning affection and future-proofing the brand for generations to come.
Purpose and equity
Vaseline exists to give every body healthy skin to live without limits. Since 2015, the brand has partnered with the humanitarian organisation Direct Relief on the Vaseline Healing Project. Through this, Vaseline provides dermatological care, medical supplies, products, health care worker training, and patient education to help heal the skin of millions affected by emergencies and poverty around the world.
The programme aims to triple its reach from 1 million to 3 million people per year by 2030. Vaseline’s purpose is able to successfully drive growth because it is articulated in a way that is locally relevant while remaining consistent around the world.
In the US, for example, Vaseline made equity a vital element of its brand purpose. In 2020, the brand launched its ‘Equitable Skin Care for All’ initiative, partnering with Medscape to better equip dermatologists and medical practitioners to accurately treat, diagnose and care for melanin-rich skin.
Vaseline is also working with healthcare tech startup HUED to connect patients with medical professionals who understand their cultural, physical and mental health needs. Through this partnership, Vaseline co-created a search tool to help people identify dermatologists of colour and those experienced in treating melanin-rich skin. Vaseline and HUED also worked with VisualDx’s clinical decision support system to create See My Skin, (Opens in a pop-up window ) the only online database designed for people to search conditions on skin of colour.
It is clear that at 150 years, the Vaseline brand is the original that never goes out of style. Fuelled by new technology based on a deep understanding of how skin works, innovation to meet the diverse needs of consumers all over the world, and a commitment to skin health for all, Vaseline is ready for its next 150 years.

text Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps we will take to halve the greenhouse gas emissions impact of our products, per consumer, by 2030, and to achieve net zero across our value chain by 2039. 
In a series of interviews, Unilever is introducing some of the many people helping to deliver our action plan and making change happen. Jon Hague, Home Care’s Head of Clean Future, Science and Technology, explains how we are changing product formulations to lower emissions and provide more sustainable options for consumers.
How long have you been working at Unilever?
I’ve been at Unilever for 32 years and what drew me to the job was my love of science. I’ve worked across many areas of research and development, from deploying products into the market to global design jobs where we create and invent new mixes that go into the brands. At the moment. I’m bringing new science and technology into the Home Care business, creating better products while we transition to a clean future. That means creating superior products that are sustainable by design and affordable to the many.
What does your day-to-day job actually involve?
The lifeblood of research and development is data from our experimental work in laboratories and with partners. That data feeds the future specifications for the products that we make. My job is setting the direction for the research that we do. Shall we look into biosciences or biotechnology? What’s out there in the world of advanced materials research that we can bring into Unilever and harness for the benefit of our products and our consumers?
When you’re using a washing product, it obviously goes into the water. We’re working to have 100% biodegradable ingredients by 2030, so our products leave very little trace behind in the water courses. But as they biodegrade, they release carbon dioxide into the air.
There are three ways we can tackle that. We can work with suppliers to drive down a material’s initial carbon footprint. We can also use biodegradable, renewable carbon where possible – carbon from plants, which goes back into the plant lifecycle rather than releasing emissions. And the third way is using something we call ‘weight efficiency’ or eco-design.
What is weight efficiency?
When I buy any material, its footprint is related to how much I’ve bought. If I currently need a 50 gram dose of powder to clean a large load of clothes, within that powder there will be a lot of chemicals. Making the chemistry of a product work harder for you, so you only need 25 grams, is a really good way of reducing carbon footprint. We call this weight efficiency.
By making chemicals more weight effective, you basically reduce the amount of material you need. We’re ensuring that for every gram of carbon we use, we’re getting much more bang for our buck. It’s a really important strategy for us and it’s served us very well throughout the business.
If you look at the laundry liquids we sell across Europe now, we’ve halved the level of the cleaning ingredients, not because we want it to clean less, but because we found different cleaning ingredients that were much more weight effective and just as powerful.
A thirdof consumers buy from brands based on their social and environmental impact*
How are product concentrations and refills helping?
If you can concentrate products, then you can ship them in much smaller volumes of water. That means that the greenhouse gas impact associated with transportation comes down. But asking consumers to use highly concentrated liquids for their washing machine, for example, can be tricky, as very small doses are harder to measure.
The alternative is setting up a dilute-at-home system where people actually dilute the concentrate themselves into a larger pack, which we’ve tried in several markets. The biggest success with this has been laundry liquids in Latin America, where we’ve built 20% of the market in dilute-at-home-from-concentrate home care products.
Dilute-at-home also dramatically reduces the packaging that’s needed, because you’re using one primary pack and a much smaller refill to handle the concentrates, so the other big benefit of concentration is the ability to minimise plastic and plastic waste.
What innovations are you currently working on?
We’re working with one of our suppliers to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and turn it into an ingredient called soda ash. It’s relatively straightforward chemistry, but when used in our laundry powders, it helps with cleaning and then it mineralises and goes to the bottom of the riverbeds and oceans. It forms carbonates that capture CO2 into the ground. It’s an exciting project where, through use of our products, carbon could be sequestered away from the atmosphere.
We also have a big programme for switching carbon that’s sourced from petrochemistry to carbon from renewable sources. We recently signed a deal with Geno to create alternatives to palm kernel oil using biotechnology. We’ve committed to having a deforestation-free supply chain by the end of 2023, so we need to find different sources to create our foaming agents and our next generation cleaning and care enzymes. That’s why we’re exploring carbon sources from across the whole ‘carbon rainbow’.
What is the carbon rainbow?
With fossil-based, or black carbon, once you’ve refined it and used it in a product, when those products biodegrade, it’s almost as though you’ve taken the crude oil and just burnt it. It’s no different – the biodegradation results in the release of that fossil carbon into the atmosphere. Unilever developed the concept of the carbon rainbow to identify alternative carbon sources we can use to replace non-renewable, fossil-based carbon.
With plant-based, or green carbon, things become circular. You grow a palm tree, it sucks in carbon dioxide, you harvest the palm, refine it and use it. When that CO2 is released at the end of the product’s life, it gets fed back into a plant-based system and becomes circular.
In a world not constrained by the size of palm plantations, you could switch all of your carbon to green carbon from palm trees. But that’s not reality – we have to protect nature. Unilever has been leading efforts to address deforestation, and we need to find alternatives to green carbon too.
Because of years of industrial use of black carbon, there are other sources of carbon already in the atmosphere that we can give a second life. Waste plastic can be harvested and converted into chemicals used for cleaning ingredients. We call that grey carbon.
Purple carbon is the concept of capturing CO2 from industrial emissions, or the atmosphere. Blue carbon is drawn from marine sources, like the highly active ingredients within seaweed. And then there’s something we call brown carbon, which is a blend of different carbon colours. It’s likely we will have to use a mix of sources to get to where we want to be, so the R&D team are exploring the creation of new sources of carbon at scale, across the whole rainbow.
Why is it important to diversify our carbon sources?
Integrating sustainability and business strategies isn’t just a moral objective anymore – it’s essential in order to future-proof your business. Soaring oil and gas prices have shown we can’t be so heavily reliant on the use of virgin fossil chemicals. We must start using non-fossil carbon feedstocks and create agile supply chains of the future if we want our business to survive.
We’ve piloted in OMO laundry liquid capsules in China, Sunlight dishwashing liquid in South Africa and Coral laundry liquid in Germany. It’s just one example of how we’re reinventing the chemistry of our Home Care products to create growth opportunities for our brands while cutting the use of fossil fuels.
Why can’t we just eradicate carbon from our products completely?
Carbon chemistry is the chemistry of this planet. It’s the chemistry of life. You’re made of carbon. I’m made of carbon. Fossil fuels got their name because they are created from the decomposed bodies of trees or marine animals. There is no other option than to use carbon because you can’t assemble useful ingredients any other way than to make them out of stitching together the carbon chain.
What would you say is the most exciting climate breakthrough you’ve seen in R&D?
Weight-efficient chemistry has been some of the best thinking and the best science that we’ve done and has also had one of the biggest impacts. There’s now half the volume of cleaning ingredients in some of our liquid products, yet they still offer a superior performance and they have made a massive dent in the carbon footprint of the product. It’s a really successful approach and it took some very clever science to unlock the magic ingredients that enabled us to take all the bulk chemicals out.
Do you feel hopeful for the future?
Yes, I do. I think in all parts of the world people are starting to look up and take notice. Business can lead the way, do the right things and genuinely act to be part of the societies that are helping take the planet in the right direction. Science is not only being applied in the service of millions of people around the world, it also has the ability to make a difference to climate change. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time and I feel privileged to have a hand in doing something about it.

text This time last year, we launched Unilever’s Positive Beauty vision, setting out how we will take action through our brands to champion an industry-leading new era of beauty that’s more equitable, more inclusive and more sustainable.
We want to ensure our brands not only do less harm but also do more good for people and the planet, and collaboration will be vital. Accelerating our science and technology partnerships and programmes will play a crucial part in bringing our vision to life.
Is your bright idea the next big thing in sustainable or biodegradable beauty?
Then we would love to hear from you.
That’s why today we’re launching a challenge to find the next generation of biodegradable and sustainable cosmetic ingredients and packaging materials that deliver incredible benefits to the millions of people who choose our products every day – and to the planet.
Through our Positive Beauty Growth Platform, we’re searching for the very best startups, scaleups and academic spinouts to partner with our teams. The aim? To bring brilliant and sustainable, functional ingredients that work with nature to our beauty and personal care portfolio.
An invitation for innovation
We’re inviting innovators and entrepreneurs to pitch their big ideas for biodegradable and sustainable solutions for hair care, skin care and deodorant products and packaging to a panel of Unilever experts.
Selected businesses will be invited to explore partnerships or potentially pilot their concepts within our Beauty & Personal Care business – a €20 billion portfolio which includes brands such as Dove, Vaseline, Rexona, TRESemmé and many more.
“We’re creating the next generation of technologies and ingredients for our beauty and personal care products that are not only highly effective but also natural and sustainable,” says Unilever’s Chief Research & Development Officer Richard Slater.
“Collaborating with disruptive new players in this space is going to lead to even more breakthroughs as we grow our business and portfolio for a future where people and planet can thrive together,” he adds.

text When you give a quick squirt of a cleaning product to polish the bathroom sink or clean the kitchen table, you probably don’t give much thought to the spray mechanism. But these ‘triggers’ are complex pieces of equipment, with several precision-engineered moving parts, including springs, valves, nozzles and gaskets.
On the one hand, they’re a triumph of innovation and clever design. On the other, they’re a problem when it comes to recycling.
A few years ago, although we stopped using metal springs, our triggers still weren’t fully recyclable, as different components were made from different plastics. We used several types because polymers have certain characteristics and are therefore suited to certain functions. For example, one part seals the cap, another picks up the final drops at the bottom of the bottle. In fact, our basic triggers have 11 components, and our more complex designs can have 15 or so.
The technical challenge
To remove the metal, we made a spring component out of polyoxymethylene (POM). However, when you put that with a bottle made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) – which is a common material used for rigid plastic packaging – the whole thing wasn’t recyclable. To recycle plastic, it’s sorted based on the material density and since both POM and PET have similar density, the recycling machinery can’t separate them properly.
To solve this conundrum, we worked with our supplier, Silgan, to come up with an innovative new trigger in which all the components are fabricated from either polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) polymers. These belong to the same group of polymers (polyolefin) and can enter the same recycling stream. In other words, the trigger is now fully recyclable alongside the bottle.
This move was critical for us to achieve one of our key business objectives: to design all our plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable.
As well as switching to the new material, we also had to modify the design of the spring component to deliver the necessary functionality. We tested lots of different grades of PP polymers to find the one with best performance.
Next job: to make it e-commerce compliant
For us to ship these bottles to our customers, we pack and stack them in a certain way to ensure there’s minimal chance of them getting damaged in transit. But when they’re sold online by a retailer like Amazon and Alibaba, for example, we don’t control the fulfilment bit – the packaging and posting. For that reason, the product must be ISTA6 compliant.
To certify that a product is ISTA6 compliant, it’s put through a series of rigorous tests, one of which is to see how it holds up when subject to impact. Our original trigger failed due to a slight leakage issue when dropped, so we modified the design to make it stronger.
Roll-out is well underway
We’re already incorporating the new triggers into our home care products across Europe for our Cif, Vim, Viss, Domestos, Lifebuoy and Lysoform brands. That means about 160 million packs – bottles and triggers – will now be recyclable every year. In terms of the triggers alone, that equates to over 3,300 tons of plastic that we have enabled for recycling. We’re also now working on plans to roll out the new triggers to other parts of the world.
“From concept to shelf, the new trigger took about three years to develop,” says Jelmer Jongsma, Packaging Development Director. “That’s because it was quite a tricky technical challenge – which included the approval of new industrial tools and modifications to the assembly line – and because we ran consumer testing in two countries to see how it performed in everyday use.
“Now that we’re rolling it out, it’s great to start reaping the benefits, from a business and environmental perspective. By making these essential changes, we can grow our e-commerce business, meet a key plastic commitment and take another step on our Clean Future journey.”
“This innovation has been possible thanks to the close cooperation between the Unilever and Silgan teams. Yet another example of Partnering with Purpose with our key suppliers,” adds our Packaging Procurement Director, Marco Massarani.
To ensure that all our plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, we have a dedicated Packaging Excellence team in R&D responsible for developing and accelerating innovations. This team includes world-class material scientists, product designers, engineers and packaging experts who collaborate with a vast network of partners in industry and academia. It’s one of the ways we’re working towards our ambition of a waste-free world.
text It is predicted that the plastic pollution crisis will surge between now and 2040, with twice as much virgin plastic created and four times more in the ocean.
So how do you fix it?
That’s the question Sian Sutherland, environmental entrepreneur and co-founder of campaign group A Plastic Planet, asked Pablo Costa, Unilever’s Head of Packaging, when she interviewed him about the global challenge of plastic pollution and what can be done to solve it.
In this wide-ranging discussion, they explore a host of topics, including the role of innovative product – not just packaging – design, what’s needed to accelerate solutions at scale and the roadblocks that are stopping us getting to the nirvana of zero waste.
They also consider whether the problem could be the catalyst for us all to rethink our current culture of take–make–dispose. As Sian puts it: “Has the plastic crisis been a tap on the shoulder of humanity to say you’ve gone down the wrong road?
text We’re making good progress towards our ambitious target of ensuring that all our plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable. Our commitment to remove 100,000 tonnes of plastic packaging entirely is also driving a shift in our packaging formats towards reuse and refill solutions.
But we’re often asked why we can’t go further and faster. One question that keeps coming up is about reusability.
We’re looking at how to introduce more reusable packaging. But there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The ways in which people buy and use our products vary hugely from market to market, and even within the same market. Finding the right solutions depends on a host of factors. Where they live. How they shop. What they buy. Likewise, different product categories may work better on the go than at home.
Packaging is not just about transport; it also has to deliver on some really important jobs, such as keeping products safe, functional and high quality. Developing reusable packaging which delivers an equal, if not superior, user experience has been a design challenge but we're learning from every insight, and improving and evolving our plans.
We’re doing a lot of work to bring about a refill-reuse revolution as part of our much wider plan to create a circular economy for plastic. We have dedicated teams to accelerate this work and we’re investing in pilot programmes all over the world to find out what works.
At-home convenience
We’re encouraging consumers to think of our cleaning and laundry products as a 'bottle for life'. For instance, our Cif spray bottles and our OMO 3-litre laundry bottles which are diluted at home with ultra-concentrated refills.
This allows us to give consumers the same products with much less plastic and conveniently smaller packaging, and they generally cost less to buy than standard size bottles. What’s more, when consumers dilute products at home, we transport far less water. This means fewer trucks on the road and therefore lower carbon emissions associated with the distribution of our products.
Our brands are challenging the throwaway culture in other ways too. Dove has started a beauty ‘refillution’ with its first-ever stainless steel refillable deodorant case which shoppers can buy once and use for life.
In-store, on the go
We’re also trialling in-store dispensing where an ever-increasing number of our brands are available at refill stations. Together with major retailers, we currently have trials running in 11 countries including our largest pilot in Europe: in Asda and Co-op stores in the UK. We also have vending machines in India where consumers can refill bottles of Surf Excel, Comfort and Vim.
Through these pilots, we’re collecting insights on which formats work best. We’re also looking at how we can communicate the environmental savings to encourage consumers to return and refill. Using on-pack QR codes, we can track the lifecycle of the bottle and the number of times it’s used, which we hope will also motivate shoppers to continue to refill and reuse.
Delivering what people really want
We’ve learnt that when it comes to refill-reuse, success depends on tailoring solutions, removing barriers to entry and keeping systems as simple as possible. To support the growth of these new formats, we need to work with consumers, customers, other businesses and governments to create the systems that allow these models to prosper.
Global change needs a whole system behind it. Governments have a critical role to play when it comes to setting standards for these systems and incentivising investment. These factors will have a significant impact on the acceptance and acceleration of reusable and refillable packaging. That’s why, alongside more than 70 other businesses, we’re calling for an ambitious and legally binding UN treaty – based on a circular economy approach – to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale.
Refill and reuse innovation is in its early days. We’re all still learning. But experimenting in real-world conditions has given us a lengthy list of insights – and an even lengthier to-do list. Now we want to build momentum and do everything we can to help bring about a refill-reuse revolution.

text In the UK, we’re changing the tubs and lids across our entire range of Carte D’Or ice cream from plastic to responsibly sourced, recyclable paper.
The move will see the brand use 93% less plastic per pack (compared to our previous Carte D’Or packaging) and is set to save over 900 tons of virgin plastic in the UK annually. 1 That’s a weight equivalent to almost five Boeing 747s.
The paper we’re using comes from sustainably managed forests and controlled sources and is PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) certified. Both tub and lid can be put into the normal household paper recycling stream.
According to research company Kantar, plastic waste is the No.1 environmental concern for British shoppers, 2 so the switch will appeal to the growing number of consumers seeking more sustainable products.
“For over 40 years, Carte D’Or has been committed to crafting delicious desserts made with some of the finest quality ingredients, which we strive to source in a sustainable way,” says Horacio Cal, Ice Cream Marketing Director for Unilever in the UK and Ireland. “Now, we’re proud to have made this move to paper tubs, helping shoppers to reduce their plastic packaging footprint at home.”
We launched the new packs at the end of January this year and we’re currently rolling them out across the country.
Why only 93%?
You might be asking yourself why we haven’t switched to paper completely. We still need to use some plastic in our packs to ensure our ice cream stays fresh, the taste and quality aren’t affected, and the packs remain durable and sturdy when shoppers take them home. The plastic we use on the inner layer of our tub and lid does not affect its ability to be recycled at home.
We also need to use a plastic seal to ensure the ice cream stays fresh and secure in the pack. At present this seal is non-recyclable, but we have a team of experts working on the transition to a fully recyclable solution.
We will use learnings and insights from this development and the roll-out of these new packs to further inform our company-wide efforts to reduce plastic packaging globally.
Our commitment to sustainability goes beyond our packaging
Since 2016, Wall’s – the umbrella brand for Carte D’Or – has been working with Save the Children and vanilla supplier Symrise to improve the lives of vanilla farming communities in the SAVA region of Madagascar, ensuring the local communities can build a better future for themselves.
The Vanilla for Change programme has already made a difference to the lives of more than 60,000 people. The project supports 10,000 households, reaching every village within our extended vanilla supply chain in the country. It has also trained and supported nearly 2,000 young people, improving their life skills and career prospects.
The new Carte D’Or packs contain a QR code which invite shoppers to interactively engage with the brand and discover more about the key ingredients which deliver the authentic Carte D’Or flavour, including the brand’s longstanding commitment to source Rainforest Alliance Certified vanilla and cocoa.
Carte D’Or’s switch to paper tubs is the latest step towards our Unilever-wide global plastic targets, which include halving the amount of virgin plastic in our packaging and achieving an absolute reduction of more than 100,000 tonnes in plastic use by 2025.

Reducing plastic across our ice cream portfolio
We’re working on all sorts of innovations, roll-outs and pilots across our ice cream portfolio to continually reduce the amount of plastic we use. Here are just a few examples.

text Flexible packaging material – which is used in sachets and for pouches that contain products like soup and sauces – is typically made with layers of different types of plastic that each provide different qualities and perform different functions. For instance, one layer prevents moisture and/or light from spoiling the contents, another seals the packaging, and another can display printed product information.
This type of material is crucial in protecting the product quality in hot, humid storage conditions in environments like market stalls. The problem is that most plastic sachets are not currently being recycled as it’s difficult to separate these various layers, and the materials have little or no economic value. As a result, flexible packaging often ends up as waste.
But in several of our markets, plastic sachets allow low-income consumers an opportunity to buy small amounts of products – often ones that provide hygiene or nutrition benefits like shampoo, toothpaste and food – which they would otherwise not be able to afford.
Different solutions for different situations
Our commitment to halve the amount of virgin plastic we use in our packaging and to achieve an absolute reduction of more than 100,000 tonnes in plastic use includes all our plastic packaging formats, including sachets.
There are no easy solutions or quick fixes. It’s a complex technical challenge which requires different approaches for different countries. We’re working on a range of solutions which will reduce our dependence on multi-layer sachets, while improving their collection and recyclability. This includes:
Refill. Reuse. Rethink. We’re testing refill solutions around the world to eliminate the need for plastic. In some regions, consumers choose to buy very small amounts of product, so in Bintaro in Indonesia, we have launched a refillery in the Saruga packaging-free store where shoppers can buy as much or as little as they want, using their own containers.
Recyclable Sachets. We’re shifting to sachets made from a single type of plastic instead of multiple layers, making it easier for the packaging to be recycled. We’re overcoming this technical challenge through innovation, and in Hanoi, Vietnam, we’ve launched a small-scale trial for recyclable mono-material sachets of Clear shampoo.
Alternative Materials. We’re trialling materials other than plastic for our sachets, such as paper which is widely recycled and collected.
Supporting Collection and Recycling Infrastructure. We’ve committed to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell. In India, four years ahead of plan, we will collect and process more than 100% of the plastic packaging we sell. Since 2018, Hindustan Unilever has facilitated the safe disposal of more than 120,000 tonnes of post-consumer-use waste. We’re also assessing new technologies that can recycle sachets, such as our CreaSolv® pilot plant in Indonesia. In 2021, we launched new packaging for our Rinso brand that uses recycled plastic processed by the plant.
In markets with comprehensive waste infrastructure, we know it's possible to recycle flexible packaging at scale. That's why we’re members of CEFLEX, a consortium working to make flexible packaging in Europe circular by 2025. Creating a circular economy for plastic requires system-level change beyond our industry, and we’re working with governments to support the development of waste infrastructure.
Where we focus our efforts
To ensure we focus on the right solutions, we’re guided by the waste hierarchy. We prioritise plastic-to-plastic recycling, which keeps it in the loop and means we can turn it back into new packaging.
Where that’s not possible, we support solutions that develop the local recycling market and provide clear community benefits. An example of this is our Philippines Misis Walastik sachet collection programme which converts sachet waste into school desks.
If we can’t identify suitable recycling solutions due to a lack of comprehensive waste management infrastructure, we will explore initiatives that recover energy from waste. Our view is that this is absolutely a last resort that provides an alternative to waste ending up in the environment or landfill, while recycling infrastructure is developed and scaled up.
With programmes in place across the world, we continue to invest in a range of solutions, including partnerships in waste collection and processing, buying recycled plastic and supporting well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility schemes into which Unilever directly pays for the collection and processing of its packaging.

text When it comes to sustainable palm oil, we want our work to benefit everyone in the areas we source from - including smallholder farmers and civil society; forests and wildlife; and governments, businesses and communities.
That’s why we’re supporting landscape programmes within Southeast Asia – in the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra, Riau and Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Sabah, Malaysia.
In a landscape approach, all stakeholders are united behind a shared vision of sustainable development, where the needs of the environment and communities are balanced. This collaborative mandate recognises that no single organisation, company or group of people alone can achieve what’s possible when everyone works together.
Today, we publish a report (PDF 14.04 MB) (Opens in a pop-up window )which offers fresh insights into our work in this area, detailing the progress we have made alongside our partners, as well as the learnings we’ve discovered along the way. By sharing our approach and impact to date, we hope to inspire others to join our journey.
The need for holistic solutions
We’re involved with these landscapes because they form part of our supply chain, have existing government commitments to sustainability, and offer clear opportunities for us to protect the forests and ecosystems, and support the surrounding communities.
By working alongside those who know the land best – local communities, governments and NGOs – towards common goals, we can help reimagine the role that palm oil can play in their landscapes.
As Willem Uijen, our Chief Procurement Officer, says: “We’re investing in landscape programmes because it’s clear that the challenges related to climate, nature and social equity are deeply interconnected and require holistic solutions. Working with our partners, we are helping to empower smallholder farmers, protect and restore forests, support governments in creating the sustainable development they seek, and progress our own sustainability goals.”

Here’s a quick snapshot of two of the programmes featured in the report.
Protecting the Leuser Ecosystem with IDH and FKL
Indonesia’s Aceh province is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains part of the largest intact tropical rainforest in Sumatra – the 2.6-million-hectare Leuser Ecosystem – which is the last place on earth where endangered wildlife, including the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceroses and elephants, can be found in the same area. With our partners IDH and the Leuser Conservation Forum (FKL), we’re helping to protect this forest.
We’re equipping the programme with Radar Alerts for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) satellite technology to help monitor – and verify – deforestation faster. Working through a multistakeholder forum, we’re helping to develop a response protocol for when deforestation alerts are received. And we’re working with farmers to restore the Leuser Ecosystem through agroforestry and nature regeneration schemes.
We’re also helping farmers obtain official documentation so they can apply for RSPO certification. This means they can increase the income they generate from their existing farmland, because certified sustainable crops command a higher price in the market. This in turn reduces pressure on the land as the farmers have less need to expand into the forest.

Supporting Sabah’s wildlife alongside WWF

The Malaysian state of Sabah is rich in forests and wildlife, and is also one of the country’s largest producers of palm oil by volume, some of which enters our supply chain.
We support the World Wide Fund for Nature’s (WWF) Sabah Landscapes programme, which forms part of a wider, government-led effort. We support forest restoration in Tawau, Kinabatangan and Lower Sugut, two of three orangutan and elephant habitats and riverside areas covered by the programme.
Through our work with WWF and other funders, we also support ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation' (NDPE) training and help prepare smallholders and outgrowers – unorganised smallholder farmers with domestic and international buyers – for RSPO and MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) certification.
Take a closer look at this programme in our Google Earth story (Opens in a pop-up window ) or dive into the detail in the Reimagining Landscapes report (PDF 14.04 MB) (Opens in a pop-up window ).
Working towards our Protect and Regenerate Nature goals
We’re committed to building a deforestation-free supply chain in palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023, to protecting and regenerating 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030, and to sustainably sourcing 100% of our key agricultural crops, including palm oil.
But we know we can’t achieve these stretching ambitions alone. Only by collaborating with others can we accelerate and scale the work required to overcome systemic environmental and social challenges. For this reason, landscape programmes are key to our approach to making sustainable living commonplace.
text Recycling plays an important role in keeping plastic waste out of the environment but we know that, on its own, it won’t solve the problem.
We already use a lot of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic to make new packaging – so we can move away from virgin material – and we’re trying to use even more. We estimate that mechanically recycled plastic has a 50% lower greenhouse gas footprint than virgin plastic.
The only way we can do that is if there’s more PCR in the system for us to buy and use. As a result, it's up to us to design packaging that can be recycled, so it can more easily go back into the ‘loop’ to make more. To that end, we helped create the Consumer Goods Forum’s Golden Design Rules for plastic packaging, which aim to accelerate progress towards using less and better plastic.
But making product packaging recyclable doesn’t automatically mean it will get recycled. That requires the infrastructure being in place to collect, sort and process.
We operate in 190 countries and the infrastructure for recycling plastic varies enormously across them. One of the greatest challenges we face is closing the gap between what is technically recyclable and what is actually recycled.
Right now, about 70% of our packaging is technically recyclable yet only half is recyclable in practice. So while we’re continuing to make progress on technical recyclability, we’re also working with local governments and other organisations to improve recycling infrastructure.
Ramping up our efforts around collection and processing
We have a goal to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell. Our business in India was the first to do this, and we have roadmaps in place with partners in Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, the UK and US.
These roadmaps include direct investments and partnerships in waste collection and processing, building capacity by buying recycled plastics, and supporting Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes in which we directly pay for the collection of our packaging.
We’re developing a technology-led solution in Indonesia, where we’re supporting urban communities to develop systems to collect and sell waste. A digital platform called ‘Google My Business’ enables consumers to find their nearest waste banks via Google Maps. Currently, around 800 waste banks are searchable – the aim is to get this to 2,000.
We also need to consider the impact of the plastic system on people’s livelihoods. In some markets, people make a living by sorting waste. We want to help these workers be part of a safe, formal recycling system. In India, for example, we’re working with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to protect the livelihoods of informal waste collectors, who help segregate, collect and recycle packaging.
The partnership has reached more than 33,000 households and collected 2,500 tonnes of plastic waste so far and will scale up to include more households in the coming years. We’re using what we’ve learned and replicating our work with UNDP with other partners in countries such as Pakistan.
Collaboration is key. Design for recyclability sits with businesses. Then we need to work with governments to achieve more ambitious recycling targets at a national level through, for example, plastic pacts. Collective action will help unlock further investment in recycling infrastructure which, in turn, will incentivise more businesses to act.

text Lack of equity is at the core of many global issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, education and economic status. At Unilever, we believe that acting on equity is essential to achieving overall equality as an outcome.
What is equality?
Equality has long been a tenet of fairness in the workplace. It looks to treat people in the same way by providing them with the same opportunities and resources.
However, this one-size-fits-all approach is only effective if everyone has exactly the same needs, because it assumes a level playing field where every individual has equal advantages or barriers. But in the real world, this is rarely the case.
So while workplace initiatives that offer the same service to everyone provide equality in doing so, they may overlook the fact that some colleagues have different needs.
What is equity?
Equity, on the other hand, recognises that we do not all start from the same place and face different barriers. As Nitin Paranjpe, Chief Transformation Officer & Chief People Officer at Unilever, acknowledges, “to reach a place where workplace opportunities are fair, just and equal, we need to take into account the different needs, cultural barriers and potential discrimination that specific groups may face in our business.”
To this end, equity may involve the use of interventions and measures to compensate for systemic bias or barriers that prevent individuals from reaching their full potential.
For example, equality will ensure that every employee has the same access to a computer, a desk, a chair and some level of training and support for the job they’ve been hired to do. Equity recognises that a person with a visual impediment may need different technology or someone in a wheelchair may need a different access to a lift.
Where we are, and where we want to be
At Unilever, our priority is getting our own house in order.
Ultimately, we want Unilever’s workforce to faithfully represent the diversity of the communities we serve. That is why we have launched a global strategy covering four areas of identity: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBTQI+ and disability.
“Our drive towards equity means that we are taking a very intentional approach to leveraging data insights to identify the policies and practices to create the conditions in which individuals and teams are supported and can thrive. Our Equity, Diversity & Inclusion strategy must benefit everyone in order to achieve an equitable and inclusive culture,” says Nitin.
While we know we have more to do, here are some examples of how we are seeking to reach this goal across our workforce, supply chain and brands:
Talent management
Our gamified talent recruitment process works to ensure there is no unconscious bias in our interview processes or assessments of performance and potential.
Gender equity in senior appointments
We have been experimenting with disruptive tools and practices, like the gender appointment ratio (GAR), developed with the Harvard Business School, to bring more awareness to unconscious bias in making senior appointments.
Gender equity in the supply chain
We proactively seek out businesses run by female founders and under-represented groups to help diversify our supply chain and we have family leave policies that allow a work–life balance and continued career progression for all parents and guardians.
Flexible working
Our markets continuously develop and implement radical new policies that support specific employee needs. Unilever supported flexible working well before COVID, and it continues to allow employees to adjust working hours to their needs.
Menstrual leave and fertility policies
Our country teams have developed policies that support the wellbeing of their workforce. For example, our Menstrual Leave Policy in North Africa and the Middle East allows women to take a day’s paid leave if experiencing pain or complications during their monthly cycle. In the UK, our Fertility Policy accommodates attendance at medical appointments and treatments for all assisted conceptions including surrogacy.
Equity-driving brands
Brands such as Dove and Vaseline are striving to bring equity to the fore. Dove is working to help promote racial equity while Vaseline has made it its mission to bring equity to skincare for black and brown skin.
Racial Equity Taskforce
In 2020, we established a Racial Equity Taskforce to accelerate the representation of black and brown talent in our four lead markets: Brazil, South Africa, the UK and the US. Our global and local HR teams are working together to remove bias from our talent management practices and processes so that, while we develop all our people, we can focus on equitably accelerating the progress of those from under-represented communities.
Driven by the individual needs of all our employees, we aim to promote diversity, inclusion and a sense of belonging that allows them not only to maximise their potential but also to bring their authentic selves to work. Ultimately, this intentionality will benefit all of our workforce and also serve to make us a better business.

text We’ve pledged to halve our use of virgin plastic by 2025. The two most important ways we plan to achieve this is by ramping up our use of post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), and by eliminating over 100,000 tonnes of plastic from our packaging.
We’re making good progress towards these targets, but we’re often asked why we can’t do this quicker.
The opportunities and challenges
PCR is a great alternative to virgin plastic because it will keep plastic out of the environment and in the circular economy. We’re ramping up our efforts here, with more of our brands using PCR all the time.
Having started at 1% in 2018, the most up-to-date figures we have – from 2020 – show that approximately 11% of our total packaging footprint now consists of PCR. This means we’re on track to achieve our 2025 goal of 25%.
Our challenge is to go beyond this goal which means there needs to be enough high-quality, post-consumer recycled materials available. There’s no shortage of plastic in the system – but turning plastic waste into usable material is not straightforward. It relies on the right packaging design, and local collection and sorting facilities.
To recycle plastic, it must be first sorted by type. For instance, HDPE (high-density polyethylene – typically used for bottles of home care products or shampoo) needs to be separated from PET (polyethylene terephthalate – often used in foods packaging) because they are processed differently. That’s not easy, which means in many countries, high-quality PCR is difficult to get hold of and is often sold at a premium.
There also needs to be more investment in waste collection and recycling technologies. This includes processes to transform more plastic waste back into high-quality, food-safe recycled plastic. Currently, this can be done through two processes: mechanical and advanced recycling.
We hope that our commitment, alongside pledges from other organisations, to use recycled content will stimulate the market to produce more, and act as a catalyst to increase the collection and reprocessing of materials.
In North America, we’re investing $15 million in the Closed Loop Partners’ Leadership Fund, to help recycle an estimated 60,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste annually by 2025 – an amount that’s equivalent to more than half of our plastic footprint in the region.
This private equity fund acquires and grows companies across the value chain that are working to increase recycling and keep valuable materials in the circular economy and out of landfills. Our investment will help secure PCR plastic supply for our brands – including Dove, Hellmann’s and Seventh Generation, which already use 100% PCR bottles – and increase access to recycled plastic feedstock processed by the companies that the fund invests in.
Our goal to halve the amount of virgin plastic we use by 2025 is a big ambition. The more others come on board and seek to tackle this together, the bigger impact we can have and help us achieve our vision of a waste-free world.
Discover more about how we’re rethinking plastic packaging
text Plastic waste is one of the biggest global environmental and human health issues we face today: an issue being driven by a linear, single-use consumption model.
To be part of the solution in creating a circular plastics economy, one where plastics are reused and recycled, Dove is accelerating and expanding its actions with renewed force.
Supporting Unilever’s recently announced goals on plastic reduction across the business, Dove has opted for long-term initiatives rather than one-off limited editions to ensure a greater and sustained impact.
In a move that will reduce more than 20,500 tonnes of virgin plastic from its portfolio per year, and support the creation of a circular plastics economy, Dove is making some significant changes to packaging and products. Here’s how.
Next year, single packs of Dove’s iconic beauty bar will be plastic-free globally1.
Development is also underway to replace the plastic outer-wrap of beauty bar multipacks with a zero-plastic material.
Better plastic
In line with Unilever’s global commitment to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025, Dove will switch to new 100% recycled plastic bottles, where technically feasible, in North America and Europe by the end of 2019. This will apply to packs across all three of the brand’s ranges: Dove, Dove Men+Care and Baby Dove2.
Dove continues to search for solutions where recycled plastic is not currently technically feasible, including for caps and pumps.
Less plastic
Dove will leverage the technology behind its new reusable, refillable, stainless steel format deodorant sticks: minim™. This technology minimises waste by radically reducing the amount of plastic required.
The launch date is not yet confirmed but work is well underway. minim™ will be trialled as part of the LOOP™ platform initiative: a first-of-its-kind, minimal waste, direct-to-consumer shopping system which launched earlier this year in cities in France and the US.
Care that goes further
“At Dove, we believe in care that goes further: for our consumers, as well as our planet,” says Marcela Melero, VP Dove Global Skin Cleansing.
“We are passionately committed to being one of the brands making the biggest impact against plastic waste. We know we’re not perfect, but we can’t afford to wait. We’re working to have the biggest positive impact we can, as quickly as we can, and empowering others to do the same.”
“Tackling plastic waste is vital for Unilever and our brands. I am proud of the work that Dove has done to revolutionise its packaging. Our aim is to transform the way we use, reuse and recycle plastic to ensure it stays in the economy and out of our communities and oceans,” adds Chief R&D Officer Richard Slater.
“By taking these steps, Dove will be the biggest brand in the world that has moved to 100% recycled packaging. This should send a clear signal to the global recycling industry that there is a huge consumer demand for recycled packaging. We will continue to innovate across our brands to change the way we use plastic for good.”
1 Production timing pending on development test results.
2 There are only few exceptions within the whole portfolio that are not fully 100% recycled bottles but still present a very high percentage in certain specific markets, and the plan is to achieve 100% very soon. In EU, Dove bottles with MuCell technology will be at 97% recycled plastic content by year end. Liquid hand wash, also with MuCell technology, will be at 97% recycled plastic but we had to postpone the implementation to Q3 2020 as we couldn’t find enough recycled plastic.

text This Human Rights Day, we’re delighted to share that Unilever has again ranked first – out of 127 companies – in the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, as assessed by the World Benchmarking Alliance.
We’re proud of this acknowledgement, but we’re well aware that more needs to be done to progress our own scores and to support the improvement of our peers’ results, as we collectively seek to address ongoing endemic human rights issues in global value chains.
Promoting human rights encompasses many different things
Human rights advocacy is often associated with protests and politics. But in practice, actions seeking to ensure freedom, equity and safety for all can look quite different.
For example, on one hand, they can be about ensuring that all workers are paid fair wages and work reasonable hours, free from harassment and abuse. On the other, they can be about respecting the rights and title to property and land.
Our new Responsible Partner Policy
At Unilever, we rely on a global ecosystem of over 66,000 partners who supply us with goods and services, or distribute and sell our finished products. Despite our commitment to such a huge network of third parties, we won’t just work with anyone.
We use our scale and reach to respect and promote human rights by working only with like-minded partners who can meet our terms of trade. Since 2014, we’ve communicated these requirements through our supplier-facing Responsible Sourcing Policy and our distributor and customer-facing Responsible Business Partner Policy. As the demands of people and planet evolve, we’re evolving too, streamlining our efforts and updating our requirements to ensure they continue to advance human rights in today’s world.
That’s why, on 8 December, we launched our new Responsible Partner Policy (RPP). This brings together our two existing policies to create a single policy which outlines our commitment to responsible business with respect for human rights as its foundation, particularly in the context of modern-day challenges for society and our planet.
The mandatory requirements outlined in our RPP are just the starting point. Ideally, we want our partners to move beyond these minimum thresholds, towards leading practices that can be shared and scaled to deliver widespread industry transformation.
As our Chief Procurement Officer Willem Uijen explains: “These are really the minimum standards we expect of our business partners and, alone, they won’t be enough to generate the meaningful transformation we seek. That’s why our RPP also encourages the development of leading practices – novel, scalable solutions – that can generate new levels of positive change in society.”
The living wage promise
One of the fundamental principles of our RPP is for all workers to be paid fair wages. As part of this, we want to see partners paying a living wage, so we’ve made doing so a ‘Future Mandatory Requirement’ which we expect our partners to prepare for.
As a business, we have committed to ensuring everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever will earn at least a living wage or a living income by 2030. To support and track partner efforts, we launched the Living Wage/Living Income Promise in 2021, through which we share our own living wage journey and offer guidance to those intent on joining our efforts to improving lives and livelihoods and strengthening business resilience.
Similarly, Unilever’s Supplier Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Promise invites partners to demonstrate that addressing the social inequality in our value chains is of paramount importance to them.
For humans to thrive, nature must too
Respect for human rights underpins all Unilever’s Compass goals. Whether we’re committing to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste, or improving health and wellbeing, it’s all driven by a respect for human rights.
One way we’re using nature-based solutions to advance social equity is through our rural dairy farmers initiative in India. In collaboration with on-the-ground experts, Mooo Farms, we’re working to reach 1,000 farmers across eight villages who supply milk to Unilever’s dairy supplier in Nabha, Patiala, in Punjab.
Together, we’re helping to share knowledge and implement best practices to improve cattle health and welfare and boost milk yields. In doing so, we hope to boost farmer incomes, lift dairy farming households out of poverty and ​reduce GHG emissions. Our aim is that, by 2025, we can cover over 3,000 farmers across several Indian districts and increase dairy farmer income by 35%.
Not only are initiatives like this the right thing to do, but they also lead to a better performing company and better performing employees.
“It’s time for us all to consider what stretching ambitions we can set to deliver meaningful change,” says Willem. “Sure, we must get the basics right first in our homes, workplaces and communities, but if that’s all we do, future humanity will still be left wanting.”
text 14 January 2015, KARACHI: Unilever Pakistan has partnered with World Wildlife Fund for Nature and Hyperstar for a unique collaboration aimed at sustaining Pakistan’s environment. A commitment of 6,000 trees has been made by Unilever’s customers as a result of this campaign, which will result in an annual reduction of approx 2 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide from Pakistan’s atmosphere.
The campaign, titled “Spend less, Protect more”, aims at educating consumers about Unilever’s ambition to halve the impact of its operations on Pakistan’s environment, as well as encouraging consumers to participate in the effort. Consumers were provided the incentive to contribute to the campaign, simply by buying Rs 500 worth of Unilever products, which would be rewarded with a tree being planted in their name by Unilever and WWF.
Hyperstar, one of Pakistan’s leading retailers, provided access to consumers through the branding of its outlets. This was further augmented through the presence of Unilever Brand Ambassadors who educated consumers about the initiative as well as the impact of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. WWF provided the expertise to educate participants about existing environmental issues and the opportunity to make a difference.
Munir Hasan, Director Modern Trade, Unilever added “At Unilever, sustainability is central to the way we do business and this partnership with WWF and Hyperstar is another step towards putting this ambition into action. This campaign is playing the dual role of creating the necessary awareness about protecting the environment as well allowing our customers to play a part simply by engaging in the shopping experience. The success of the campaign is evident considering that over 11,000 consumers engaged with this initiative in the space of just two weeks!”
As well as the positive impact on the environment, there has also been a sharp increase in positive consumer engagement as a result of this initiative. The campaign reached out to 11,000 shoppers over the duration of the campaign. This provides the necessary encouragement for a number of similar campaigns to be launched in future.
Unilever Pakistan is a subsidiary of Unilever Plc, which operates in over 100 countries. Established in Pakistan in 1948, the Pakistan business is amongst the country’s largest consumer goods companies. Unilever is one of Pakistan largest taxpayers, and contributed a total of PKR 24.4 billion to Pakistan’s exchequer in 2013 alone.
Unilever’s brands such as Lux, Lifebuoy, Lipton, Sunsilk, Surf Excel and Wall’s are known for their consistently high quality & value and are trusted & consumed daily by millions of people across Pakistan. Unilever’s brands strive to create a better future every day for consumers across Pakistan.
Lifebuoy reaches out to thousands of children through its hand washing campaign, raising standards of hygiene; Lux promotes film, fashion and music through the iconic Lux Style Awards; Sunsilk partners PFDC in the fashion weeks and Blue Band supports nutrition.
As one of Pakistan’s most preferred employers, Unilever directly employs over 2000 people across the country, and indirectly contributes to the employment of many thousands through its nationwide sales and distribution network.
Unilever’s ambition is to double its business whilst reducing its environmental footprint and enhancing its positive social impact. It is engaged in a number of initiatives to enhance livelihoods, save water, energy, carbon emissions and to cut waste and promote recycling. For more information: www.unilever.pk.

text Today is the day the world recognises fundamental human rights such as the right to life, to health, to food and to enjoy an adequate standard of living that many of us take for granted, but still more are unable to access.
This year’s Human Rights Day is dedicated to equality and, in particular, to rebuilding a world that is better, fairer and greener. It follows on from the UN Human Rights Council’s decision on 8 October to recognise access to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a universal human right, as called for by organisations including Unilever.
The impact of climate change on human rights
People living in vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and are at higher risk of Human Rights violations.
Many of them have experienced human rights harms caused by climate change first hand, from extreme weather conditions impacting their access to natural resources such as clean water or a fall in agricultural productivity.
For example, 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Four million girls in low and lower middle-income countries were prevented from completing their education in 2021 because of climate-related events.
On Human Rights Day, we look at four ways we’re working across Unilever to address climate change and help the communities most impacted by it.
Taking action on climate change is taking action on human rights
Taking individual action begins by becoming informed on how your decisions impact the environment. Consider getting involved in your local community and finding out how you can make a difference at a local level.
For ideas on how you can help ensure a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, visit the Unilever Take Action Hub. You can also share your support for this right by adding your photo to a UN filter here and sharing it on social media using the hashtag #StandUp4HumanRights.

text In 2021, a record-breaking 500,000 people globally (Opens in a pop-up window ) signed up to eat only plant-based for the first month of the year. And in 2022 pledges to Veganuary look set to be even higher.
In a survey of 2000 people (Opens in a pop-up window ) in the UK, 33% said they were ready to commit to plant-based eating. But as with many resolutions, the challenge of 100% commitment can see many give up at the first hurdle.
Going ‘cold turkey’ rarely works. In the same survey, one in four didn’t expect to make it beyond a fortnight of plant-based eating due to lack of willpower, boredom and missing out on their favourite meals and snacks.
“It’s completely normal to find yourself struggling with the idea of cravings or giving up a particular food,” says Magnum Vice President Julien Barraux. “Most vegans stop eating animal products for ethical reasons, not because they don’t enjoy the taste of them.”
Transitioning to a new way of eating takes time if it’s going to sustainable. Instead of all or nothing, why not use Veganuary to explore what works for you and what doesn’t?
The first weeks of the new year can be your time to find your own rhythm for incorporating plant-based foods – whether that’s trying out a vegan alternative of a snack you love or a new recipe that swaps out meat or dairy for an alternative plant-based protein.
A bite-sized taster to plant-based
And here’s where Magnum can help.
Just in time for Veganuary, the brand is launching its award-winning vegan ice cream stick bars in a mini-sized multi-pack that include a selection of two winning vegan flavours: Magnum Vegan Classic and Magnum Vegan Almond. Two of the brand’s vegan flavours whose quality and taste saw themreceive the PETA Vegan Food Award.
The new format offers consumers all the indulgence and pleasure of a vegan Magnum.
“Many of us begin January with the intention of taking a more mindful approach to what we eat,” says Julien. “Our naturally derived plant-based Vegan Minis allow consumers to indulge more often, in an eco-conscious way, with 100% Magnum pleasure.
“Research tells us 60% of Gen Z and millennials cannot get through the day without a snack, so our Minis are just the right size for a bite-sized introduction to plant-based ice-cream,” he adds.
Just like their full-sized siblings, each Mini Magnum is richly coated in dairy-free chocolate made from coconut oil and cacaobutter from sustainably sourced West African cocoa certified by The Rainforest Alliance.
Their smooth ice cream is made from pea protein flavoured with high-quality Madagascan vanilla. A delicious combination that provides tastebuds with an indulgent creamy experience without the need for dairy.
Introducing Vegan Hazelnut Crunch, the latest flavour to be added to Magnum’s range of vegan ice cream sticks 
A new favour for the New Year – Vegan Hazelnut Crunch
And Magnum is not leaving out lovers of full-sized desserts. There’s a new year treat in store for them too. The brand is expanding its portfolio of vegan flavours with the introduction of Vegan Hazelnut Crunch.
The new addition promises consumers a velvety duo of hazelnut and caramel flavoured ice cream swirls encased in a layer of luxurious plant-based cracking chocolate with crunchy hazelnut pieces. And one more flavoursome way to experience 100% Magnum pleasure, without any dairy.
Increasing consumers’ options to try plant-based products is something that’s also appreciated by the team behind Veganuary. “We’re thrilled that Magnum is launching vegan Magnum Minis and Vegan Hazelnut Crunch this January,” says Veganuary’s Head of Communications Toni Vernelli.
“Veganuary’s role is to help people choose plant-based foods, whether their motivation is health, planet, people or animals. And it is much easier to persuade people to try vegan if there is plenty of great-tasting, high-quality food like this readily available in stores,” she adds.
text Over the years, Lifebuoy has helped more than 1 billion people adopt better handwashing habits to help keep germs at bay. Now the brand is taking its social mission to the next level, supporting millions more to improve their health and hygiene through its telehealth partnerships.
Getting seen by a doctor is a chronic challenge across the world, and especially in some of Lifebuoy’s biggest markets. In Vietnam, for example, there are only eight doctors for every 10,000 patients. In Indonesia, the figure’s just three doctors per 10,000.
That’s why Lifebuoy is turning to technology to make a difference. With healthcare systems under enormous strain and consumers dealing with intermittent lockdowns that restrict their ability to travel, many are using telehealth apps and websites to book telephone consultations. Governments have started to promote such services too.
So far, Lifebuoy has teamed up with leading telehealth providers in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Pakistan to expand the reach of these vital platforms – and it will continue to scale up availability to further democratise healthcare. The brand is using its packaging and its commercials to drive consumers to these platforms, where they can receive free doctor consultations and healthcare advice.
Lifebuoy’s telehealth activations have reached almost 300 million people since 2020, forming a large part of the brand’s Covid-19 response.
Evolution, purpose and growth
Lifebuoy’s handwashing messages are integrated into the telehealth apps and websites, enabling the brand to boost its thought leadership and expertise credentials while reaching communities across rural regions.
“For over a century, Lifebuoy has used its behaviour-change expertise to help inspire more people to wash their hands with soap more often. Now we are committed to improving access to health care too,” explains Triveni Rajagopal, Global Digital Director, Skin Cleansing & Oral Care.
Lifebuoy was named the third most-chosen brand in the world in this year’s Kantar Brand Footprint report. The telehealth partnerships are a crucial addition to the brand’s traditional product range, connecting those most in need with crucial healthcare consultation services. Looking ahead, Lifebuoy telehealth will continue to expand to more countries.
“Telemedicine is invaluable for our consumers and makes business sense when it comes to Lifebuoy’s plans for further growth. Partnering with digital healthcare providers sees us evolve from the world’s leading hygiene soap brand * to one that is helping improve access to healthcare for millions of individuals as well,” says Kartik Chandrasekhar, Global Brand Vice President, Lifebuoy, Unilever.
text Plastic is a valuable material. It is crucial for the safe and efficient distribution of products, and it has a lower carbon footprint than many alternatives. The problem is, far too much of it ends up in the environment.
In fact, it’s predicted that the plastic pollution crisis will surge between now and 2040 with twice as much virgin plastic created and four times more in the ocean.
We can’t let that happen.
But banning plastic altogether isn’t the answer. The solution lies in reducing the use of virgin plastic (making as little as possible in the first place) while keeping all plastic that is produced in a circular economy (treating it as a resource rather than waste).
We’re working hard on both these fronts because we fully accept that the plastic we produce is our responsibility. We have pledged to halve our use of virgin plastic by 2025 – partly by eliminating over 100,000 tonnes of plastic from our packaging – and design all our packaging to be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable. And we’re making good progress.
We’re also signed up to voluntary industry agreements, including the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment which aims to eradicate plastic waste and pollution at source, and various Plastic Pacts which bring together governments, NGOs and businesses to accelerate progress towards the reuse and repurposing of plastic.
These agreements are working. According to the Global Commitment 2021 Progress Report, the brands and retailers involved have collectively reduced their consumption of virgin plastic in packaging for the second year running. This trajectory will be accelerated by new commitments that are set to see virgin plastic use fall by almost 20% in absolute terms by 2025 compared to 2018.
But while things are moving in the right direction and gaining momentum, these types of commitments alone aren’t enough: we need to go much further and much faster.
Without changes to how nations use, recycle and ultimately reduce plastic usage, we will not fix the problem. We need tough, global action that gets to the root cause. And in some cases that means moving from voluntary to mandatory measures.
That’s why, alongside more than 70 other businesses, we’re calling for an ambitious and legally binding UN treaty – based on a circular economy approach – to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale, similar to how the Paris Agreement put us on a path to tackle the climate crisis.
We all need a shared goal and approach
Plastic pollution doesn’t start and finish at national boundaries, so the world needs a cohesive and coordinated international response that deals with the problem at its source. A circular economy for plastic will also help tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, while at the same time bringing positive social and economic impacts.
We believe the treaty should align everyone – governments, businesses and civil society – behind a common understanding of the causes and a shared approach to address them. For companies and investors, this creates a level playing field and prevents a patchwork of disconnected ambitions and solutions, while establishing the right conditions for a circular economy for plastic to work in practice, at scale.
We also believe that it must be legally binding and include mandatory targets to limit virgin plastic production – at national government level to drive accountability. Ensuring that every country participates and complies will unlock the investment required to scale innovations, infrastructure and skills in those places most in need of support.
And there’s good reason to be optimistic that such a treaty can be created and adopted: three-quarters of UN member states – over 150 countries – already back the idea, as do an increasing number of businesses and investor groups. People are also demanding action. WWF’s petition calling for the treaty has so far been signed by over 2 million people. But we need more organisations and people to show their support – to exert pressure on all governments to get to work on delivering the treaty.
We already have the solutions needed to reduce the annual flow of plastic into the ocean by about 80% by 2040. As the Breaking the Plastic Wave report by The Pew Charitable Trusts points out, it’s not the lack of technical solutions that’s preventing us from addressing plastic pollution, but rather inadequate regulatory frameworks, business models and funding mechanisms.
"We’re at a critical point in time to establish an ambitious UN treaty on plastics. One that cuts down virgin plastic production, fosters collaboration for systemic solutions, and speeds up the transition to a circular economy globally," says Unilever CEO Alan Jope.
“At the upcoming UN Environment Assembly, a process to deliver legally-binding goals must be agreed before it’s too late. The scale and complexity of the crisis is well understood. Momentum is there, and we know what needs to be done. Now is the time to take those tough decisions, to tackle plastic pollution once and for all.”
We urgently need a global legally binding agreement that involves every country in ending this crisis by 2030. There is no time to waste.

text Meet Gun Gun, one of our 2021 Unilever Heroes. Every year, in the Heroes Awards, we recognise a handful of employees who have gone above and beyond their day job. Against the difficulties of the last 12 months, their stories are even more remarkable, bringing help and hope to communities around the world. We are deeply proud of them.
How do you help food businesses that have been badly hit by Covid? Unilever chef Gun Gun Handayana from Jakarta explains how he has been helping his customers despite the pandemic restrictions.
Hospitality and food service in Indonesia, as elsewhere around the world, experienced massive negative impacts as a result of Covid-19. “Restaurants became mausoleums, housing only empty chairs,” says Gun Gun, who is Executive Head Chef of Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) in the country. “Nobody was going out to eat – I saw so many of my customers struggling with their businesses.”
As Indonesia gradually reopened after the lockdowns, many restrictions on personal mobility remained. How could customers best be reached with ideas for new menus, product information and training?
Virtual demos
The first answer was for Gun Gun to acquire new skills in food photography and video-making. Working from home in his own kitchen, he created new dishes which he turned into assets that could be used to inspire chefs.
And at the start of the pandemic in Indonesia in March 2020, Gun Gun hired ten third-party chefs, covering every region in Indonesia. When Covid restrictions prevented the core chef team from travelling, the third-party chefs representing UFS were available to visit customers. So from the start of the pandemic up to the end of 1 June 2021, Gun Gun and his colleagues gave over 5,000 cooking demonstrations (up from 419 the previous year), on-site where possible and virtually where it was not.
And bucking the business trend during Covid, market penetration increased 21% in 2020, compared to 2019.
Helping young entrepreneurs
Launching a new business in the restaurant sector is challenging in Indonesia, and young entrepreneurs appreciate all the help they can get. Gun Gun led efforts to set up UFS’s entrepreneurship programme in June 2021 to mentor 30 culinary start-ups. The entrepreneurs involved – from street hawkers up – are located across Indonesia, mainly in the big cities, and are receiving help in areas such as food safety.
Meal4Meal programme
The Covid outbreak offered the opportunity for Unilever Food Solutions to thank Indonesian healthcare workers for their efforts in fighting the pandemic. Gun Gun spearheaded UFS’s Meal4Meal programme to support medics in the Jakarta area.
Collaborating with local food operators, he supervised this ambitious programme. Meals were prepared offsite by operators known for their high safety standards. In all, over 27,000 meals were delivered to overworked frontline medics who were dealing with high levels of Covid.
As his brother is also a doctor, Gun Gun understood the stress that medical staff were under and how quality food could lift morale. “Meal4Meal is one of the best experiences that Unilever Indonesia has contributed to the nation,” he says.
All of this comes naturally to Gun Gun. “I can’t imagine my life without a spatula, a wok and my kitchen,” he says. “I was born to cook!”
text Meet Archita, Rakshit and Souvik, three of our 2021 Heroes. Every year, in the Heroes Awards, Unilever recognises a handful of employees who have gone above and beyond their day job. Powered by passion and purpose, the 2021 Heroes have brought help, hope and tangible improvement to communities around the world.
Unilever’s business in India, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), enjoys wide respect across the country and has long been recognised as a compassionate caring company.
Now the current generation of HUL’s workforce have taken up the baton and created new ways of helping employees and communities in need. And three individuals – Archita Priya, Rakshit Shetty and Souvik Maity – have been named Unilever Heroes 2021 for their initiative in helping to support employees during the second deadly wave of Covid in India.
Archita Priya, Senior IT Manager in Bangalore, describes the situation as it unfurled. “When the second wave came, it felt like a tsunami. There were over 400,000 cases a day and the whole country was on its knees. It was really frightening.”
“It was difficult not only mentally but also physically,” recalls Rakshit Shetty, who works in Marketing in Mumbai.
The country’s healthcare systems were unable to cope and people struggled to access medical resources. And like the rest of the country, HUL found itself in the thick of the pandemic. ​​
At one point, the company had more than 1,500 people – out of a workforce of 90,000 (Unilever employees and the outer core) – down with Covid. The total number of cases that HUL witnessed during the second wave was upwards of 4,500.
The Medical & Occupational Health (M&OH) team worked round the clock to offer support to employees across the country and help identify resources such as hospital beds, medicines, oxygen supply and testing. But there was an information gap between the requests from employees and the services that the company doctors were able to provide. The requests kept on coming and the team were impossibly stretched.
“The entire problem could only be resolved by people having the right kind of technology supported by the right kind of back-end operations,” says Souvik Maity, who works in HR in Mumbai.
Solutions: the helpline and app
Better information was needed. To resolve the problem, Archita, Rakshit and Souvik were brought together, with the support of their line managers. The three worked long hours, sometimes starting as early as 5.30am and continuing late into the night. “Those were crazy nights,” Souvik remembers.
Clearly, a single helpline, backed by a robust IT infrastructure, would help immeasurably. “We just wanted to help, so we used our skills to build a dashboard and app,” explains Rakshit. “Our goal was to organise this very chaotic situation to make as much impact as possible. We knew we could make a difference.”
In just under ten days, the HUL healthcare helpline was live across India. The helpline was backed by the HUL healthcare app, helping the call centre team assign cases to doctors and volunteers, using an algorithm that took account of case load and location. The central M&OH team had access to a Power BI dashboard, providing ‘at a glance’ information, which helped them monitor each case in real time.
The helpline was made available to all HUL employees, the outer core and their extended families. As the situation was so serious, vendor partners working with HUL were also allowed to call in with their requests.
Both doctors and the ‘Nightingale’ volunteers received notification on the app, or via email or text message (SMS), when cases were allocated to them. Having this transparency also meant cases could be tracked at a site level, and it flagged up the need for emergency action if it was required.
Getting people to call in a helpline number instead of directly calling their usual Unilever doctor also required behaviour change among employees. “We worked with teams to make sure the wallpapers on the laptops of employees in India contained information about the helpline,” explains Archita. “It was important that the number should be well known to them and accessible at all times,” she adds.
The work in setting up the helpline and app was immense but swiftly executed. “Passion was at the core of us cracking this,” says Souvik.
The Nightingale network
At the same time, a network of individual volunteers was set up in parallel. These were the Nightingales – a group of volunteers drawn from all functions within Unilever’s operations in India. The Nightingales network launched in April 2021 with a team of 30. Within two weeks, the team had grown to over 150.
Archita, Rakshit and Souvik trained both the Nightingales and the doctors on how to use the app. The three arranged multiple sessions to get everyone on-board with the new processes and were always available to answer questions.

The Nightingales divided up the responsibilities. A key part of their work was to help procure oxygen concentrators and medicines, and to identify hospital beds and plasma donors. Injected drugs were sometimes needed to counter black fungus – a rare infection which had re-emerged as a further Covid-related risk.
“With a daily increase in Covid cases of around 4 lakhs [400,000], the health infrastructure had pretty much collapsed,” says Archita. “This made the job of the team a pretty tough one – keeping themselves sane and working towards the end-goal of assisting with healthcare needs.”

Helping families, saving lives
Through their efforts, the Nightingales have helped support more than 1,500 employees and their extended families.
“It feels amazing to have worked as a team and made such a difference,” says Souvik.
Archita, Rakshit and Souvik emphasise that they were part of a wider team who, despite the heavy demands created by external circumstances, went beyond the call of duty. They highlight the dedication of the entire team. “And we’d like to thank our leadership for bringing us together,” Archita adds.
For Archita, there was a personal resonance when the helpline gave emergency support to her own family. “It came full circle for me when the very network we had built helped get a hospital bed for my dad, when my family members and I were affected by Covid soon after,” she says. “For me, working on the helpline seemed like the best way to cope.”
text In June, Blueair launched its Freedom to Breathe campaign with the aim of making clean air a right under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The campaign amplified the voices of children around the world, like nine-year-old Mathilda who was upset by the unfairness of some children having clean air while others didn’t, and eight-year-old Hugo who fervently believed that kids like him had the power to make the world listen.
He was right. People did listen, and we are now delighted to announce that thanks to thousands of children like Mathilda and Hugo, and the Freedom to Breathe campaign led by our brand Blueair in partnership with Global Action, the Coalition for Clean Air, the Centre for Environment Education and Safe Kids Worldwide, the UN has acknowledged that clean air should be the right of every child.
A win for kids and clean air
This landmark decision comes after of months of campaigning by over 29,000 children across the US, India, China and the UK.
“By working directly with children, giving them a voice and empowering them, we have succeeded in convincing the UNCRC to acknowledge their right to clean air within the Convention on the Rights of the Child – in the same way as their right to education, shelter and clean water are currently recognised,“ says Sara Alsén, Chief Purpose Officer at Blueair.
For Sara, the turning point in the campaign was when Blueair hosted 29,674 children from around the globe at ‘Freedom to breathe: A Child’s Right to Clean Air’ – a virtual event where they were encouraged to present their views and questions to Philip D Jaffé, Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
“I really think it was during that meeting that both sides understood each other,” she says, adding that it was following the event that the Vice Chair confirmed that clean air would now be elevated within the UNCRC through the forthcoming General Comment No.26.
“We need an air quality revolution,” he said, explaining that the committee would work on including every child’s right to clean air in the upcoming General Comment (No.26). “I will do my part and I will do everything I can with my colleagues to support you in what you are doing,” he added.
Why urgent action is needed now
This acceleration within the UNCRC reflects the urgency of the global situation. Nine out of ten children around the world are breathing in toxins that exceed safe levels and can interfere with critical stages of organ development in a child.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2016 alone, 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air, and UNICEF predicts that if nothing is done, air pollution will become the leading cause of child mortality by 2050. Clearly there is no time to lose, and it is hoped that the recognition of clean air as a right by the UN will lead to fast action on both a national and international level.
Good for kids, good for business
There is no doubt that Blueair has grabbed headlines because of the Freedom to Breathe campaign, but behind the scenes the brand has been working for years to improve the air quality of schools in areas of low air quality and low economic wealth.
Through donations of air purifiers to schools and children’s hospitals, Blueair has improved access to clean air for over 1 million children. In addition, it has been providing teaching resources aligned with school curriculums in Beijing, Los Angeles, New Delhi and London in order to the help children learn about the importance of clean air and how they can protect themselves from unnecessary sources of air pollution.
“Our philanthropic work is essential, but it is only possible because of the extraordinary growth we have enjoyed over the last couple of years, thanks to ground-breaking innovations like HealthProtect and DustMagnet. The brand has achieved record turnover this year,” says Sara. “There is no doubt that doing good is good for our business, but it is only possible if business is growing.”
Children everywhere should have the right to clean air
text The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a call for action by all countries to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They were set up in 2015 with a target date of 2030. But as we approach the halfway point on that timeline, it’s clear we’re not getting there fast enough.
Clever solutions to the challenges are being created by entrepreneurs around the world. They are building businesses that provide essential services, including expanding access to healthcare for women, delivering clean water and sanitation, and transforming the way plastic is used and reused.
What’s missing is the ability to scale up these businesses. And that’s where TRANSFORM comes in.
This joint initiative between Unilever, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and professional services company EY supports entrepreneurs in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in the areas of environment, inclusive economies and health and wellbeing. TRANSFORM blends grant funding with expert technical assistance from Unilever and EY employees, who also provide access to their networks and corporate value chains.
Over the last six years, TRANSFORM has delivered £40 million (€48 million) in funding and business support to over 60 enterprises in 13 countries, and positively impacted the lives of 7 million people.
We’re now extending the initiative until at least 2025 with up to £40 million (€48 million) in cash and in-kind support. Our ambition is to reach 15 million people through supporting social enterprises and research projects with a particular focus on scaling the circular economy, especially plastic waste, and digital health models.
As Richard Wright, Unilever Behavioural Science Director and a leading player in TRANSFORM, says: “Creativity and entrepreneurism are alive and well at the base of the pyramid – treat the underserved as innovation partners rather than beneficiaries, and real change will be achieved.”
New one-stop-shop to connect and collaborate
As part of expanding the initiative, we have launched the TRANSFORM Support Hub in partnership with software firm SAP and platform operator Moving Worlds. The Hub offers a more effective way for social enterprises, professionals and corporates to connect and collaborate.
It’s a one-stop-shop through which social enterprises can access learning modules and pro-bono support from skilled professionals, make corporate connections and network with peers and investors.
As Unilever Global Sustainability Director Clive Allison says: “We need more partnerships that help achieve the SDGs, and bring together diverse perspectives, knowledge and approaches to tackling the world’s biggest development challenges.”
The Hub is a flagship initiative of the Global Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship (GASE) and is hosted by the World Economic Forum.
Visit the TRANSFORM Support Hub to find out more.
Next stop, Latin America
Building on our success in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, we have joined forces with the Global Solidarity Fund (GSF) to replicate the TRANSFORM approach in Latin America, starting with Colombia.
Unilever CEO Alan Jope, who launched the new partnership at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, said: “Our partnership with the Global Solidarity Fund to expand the successful TRANSFORM initiative into Colombia reflects our shared ambition to create a more inclusive economy through training and job opportunities for marginalised workers.”
The partnership will leverage TRANSFORM’s capabilities and expertise in marketing, distribution, digital and business resilience to deliver transformative market-based solutions that last. It will focus on fostering social entrepreneurship and impacting labour markets for inclusion of migrants and refugees.
Marta Guglielmetti, GSF’s Executive Director, said: “The Global Solidarity Fund will bring unique value to the partnership, connecting social entrepreneurs with organisations that are deeply trusted by local communities with a recognised knowledge of vulnerable migrants and refugees’ skills and needs.”
If you’re a social enterprise looking for support, an organisation interested in joining the partnership or a professional with expertise and knowledge to offer, visit the TRANSFORM Support Hub for more information.

text Across the globe, almost half a billion people earn their income by working on small family farms. But this life can be hard. Many don’t have access to training, financial support or even rights to their land. And a changing climate is increasingly affecting harvests, making their livelihoods ever more fragile.
Yet, when empowered with the right knowledge, skills and opportunities, they can be stewards of the land: vital partners in the effort to stop deforestation and regenerate nature.
Since 2010, Unilever has empowered 834,000 smallholder farmers to improve their agricultural practices and increase their livelihoods.
An example of this is a palm oil project we’re running in Indonesia’s Central Kalimantan region. With our partner Yayasan Inobu – a non-profit research institute – alongside local governments and farming co-operatives, we’re working to improve the yields and incomes of smallholders.
We started in 2016, working with smallholder farmers to apply sustainable agricultural practices. To date, we’ve helped certify more than 1,000 smallholders in two districts – according to principles of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification systems – and we’re in the process of helping 2,500 more. This has created the first certified sustainable villages in the palm oil industry, which means oil palm sourced from these areas is responsibly produced.
Benefits for the whole community
One reason why the productivity of oil palm smallholders is generally low is because many still have limited access to more technical knowledge and skills. Few have the resources to support themselves through certification.
Through Inobu’s programme, we’re seeing a significant change in how farmers treat the environment, particularly in terms of managing waste, and protecting the land and surrounding water sources.
The extra income derived from better yields and from selling certified sustainable palm oil – which can be sold at a higher price – is channelled into upgrading facilities and services that benefit the whole community. In Pangkalan Tiga village, for example, the extra income is used to support a convenience store to meet people’s daily needs and an agro-tourism site to provide more leisure activities.
A new integrated cattle ranch allows the community to repurpose waste materials and provides additional economic value to the farmers. Palm by-products such as fronds are used in feed for livestock, cow manure is used for fertiliser for the oil palms, and a by-product from the mill is used in fish feed.
The smallholders of Pangkalan Tiga village have been able to switch to more sustainable farming methods and to better support their families.
Rauf Prasodjo, Sustainable Sourcing Manager
A novel approach
Our project with Inobu is one example of how we’re working to transform the palm oil industry using what’s called a jurisdictional approach to certification. That means looking at sustainability on a village, district or province level through the lens of a set of indicators to be measured against and complied with. The idea is that, once a jurisdiction obtains certification, all commodities coming from there can be counted as sustainably produced.
“At Unilever, we know we must work in partnership when driving transformational change for planet and people,” says Rauf Prasodjo, our Sustainable Sourcing Manager. “Thanks to the expertise and deep local knowledge of Inobu and the support of local governments and farmer co-operatives, the smallholders of Pangkalan Tiga village have been able to switch to more sustainable farming methods and to better support their families.”
We have similar programmes that reach more than 9,000 independent oil palm smallholders across Indonesia and Malaysia with the help of partners. To continue supporting the demand for certified sustainable palm oil, Unilever has been one of the largest buyers of RSPO smallholder credits. Our aim is to incentivise smallholders to continuously implement sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices.
“The tangible benefits to farmer communities since the start of the project have been encouraging,” says Heni Martanila, Certification Manager at Yayasan Inobu. “Some smallholder farmers tell us they’re glad they took up the sustainable farming training we provided. That, to us, is great validation.”

text Cheap, flexible and multipurpose plastic has become the ubiquitous material of today’s fast-moving economy. Modern society would be lost without it.
But our ‘take-make-dispose’ approach to consumption means that most packaging rarely gets used a second time. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, around 95% of the value of plastic packaging is lost to the economy after one short use.
It’s unsustainable.
As a business, we’re acutely aware of the causes and consequences of this model. And we are working hard to change it.
One way we’re doing that is by exploring different options around refill and reuse.
The benefits
Reducing the need for plastic is clearly good for the environment. The urgency to act on plastic pollution is now widely understood and many large organisations – including Unilever – are committed to creating a circular economy for plastic. Recycling is important, but it’s just one component. Refillable and reusable could well be the gamechanger we need.
At the same time, consumers are increasingly demanding more eco-friendly packaging and a reduction in plastic. Preferences are also shifting to more sophisticated packaging, including higher quality and even personalised. Innovative reuse models can tap into these shifting trends by, for example, delivering better-looking, more functional packaging that allows customisation.
This, in turn, presents a business opportunity. Through more convenient models and more attractive packaging, we can deliver a superior user experience and build brand loyalty. It can also help save costs, particularly in terms of transportation.
According to a new report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (PDF 17.15 MB), replacing just 20% of single-use plastic packaging with reusable alternatives offers an opportunity worth at least $10 billion.
A few of the initiatives we’re working on
Here are some examples of the trials we’re currently running. Success is very dependent on consumers changing their behaviour and that’s something we can’t control. But we’ll continue to test, learn and refine so we can deliver a range of solutions that work.
Cif ecorefill is a new technology that allows consumers to refill and reuse their Cif spray bottles for life. 
At the beginning of this year, nine of our brands started trialling reusable packaging innovations on LOOP, a global, first-of-its-kind, waste-free shopping system. 
In Chile, we’re partnering with Algramo to pilot an app-powered, intelligent dispensing system that uses electric tricycles to deliver to people’s homes. 
A pilot from All Things Hair – our content platform for hair inspiration and advice – brought a whole new model of eco-friendly shopping to consumers in the Philippines. 
In Brazil, the concept of a concentrated product where you only need a much smaller dose than normal has never really taken off. 
The challenges
There are several ways in which refill-reuse models could work. You can fill up your container at home using refills you buy at a shop or online. You can use an in-store dispensing machine at a large supermarket. You can get your empty containers picked up from home, replenished and delivered back. Or you can return packaging at a store or drop-off point, as part of a deposit-return scheme.
While different options will suit different people and different circumstances, they all pose their own challenges.
From a business perspective, there are various considerations. For example, putting a dispensing machine in a shop or picking up empty packaging to wash, refill and return requires very different distribution and logistics operations that, to work, need to be efficient and economically viable.
Deposit and reward schemes must be carefully thought through to ensure they incentivise the return of packaging without putting consumers off with a high initial deposit. And if we want consumers to return bottles, we need to make sure there are enough drop-off points in the right locations.
But even if business gets this side of the equation sorted, we can’t force consumers to buy into the idea. That's why we need to work with others on this transition. It requires people to change often long-held habits in terms of how they both shop and consume.
Will consumers think it’s too much hassle to clean their containers and take them to a shop to refill them? It’s becoming the norm for us to carry refillable water bottles, but is it a step too far to lug big laundry bottles back and forth?
Will they be tempted by smaller, less impressive looking refill packs that sit alongside full-sized products on the supermarket shelf?
Will they trust that a concentrated refill diluted with water at home really does have the same cleaning power?
As Richard Slater, Unilever’s Chief R&D Officer, explains: “This is a really exciting area and one where we’re aiming to take a leading role. While we’ve been designing potential solutions and experimenting for some time, it’s a new and very different concept for consumers.
“We’re trailing various approaches to tackle the issue, as there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution. We’re determined to make a real difference on the plastics challenge, and so we’ll continue to experiment and to test, learn and refine.”
Closing the loop
The other thing to remember is that this won’t necessarily get rid of plastic completely. Plastic is still involved in some way in most models – in the small refill bottles or the bulk dispensing containers in-store. Plus of course, for the most part, the initial reusable container is made from plastic.
What’s important is that these models – if designed and implemented correctly – will dramatically reduce the amount of plastic in circulation. Plus, to really ‘close the loop’, we need to make sure that most, if not all, the various elements are themselves widely recyclable.

text The global digital commerce market is expected to total over $200 billion in 2021, according to research company Kantar, * which represents an increase of more than 27% on last year.
For Unilever, online shopping continues to be a key growth driver. In fact, Covid-19 triggered such huge disruption that, in some markets like the US, we saw many years of growth within three months.
We spoke to Global VP of Digital Commerce Claire Hennah to find out how we’re operating in this fast-paced, ever-changing environment.
How much does digital commerce contribute to our overall sales?
So far this year, digital commerce delivered €5 billion of sales and in quarter three alone grew at 38%. It now accounts for 12% of total company sales.
What has sparked the rapid rise?
In 2020, with more people shopping online due to Covid restrictions, our digital commerce business grew by over 60%.
Covid certainly continues to boost online traffic, especially among baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964). A certain amount were already early adopters of online, but the pandemic has pushed more towards the channel. There’s also been an influx of other new user groups, the most obvious being the digital native Gen-Z (those born between 1997 and 2012).
As the channel matures and retailers invest more to make relevant content available and accessible across all demographics, we can reach far more online shoppers than ever before.
Also, new models such as quick commerce (rapid order to delivery time) and social commerce (buying through platforms like Instagram and Pinduoduo) are emerging across the world, with consumer expectations setting the pace for convenience.
How are our brands adapting?
When designing for digital commerce, it’s imperative to keep the consumer experience at the heart of everything we do. Many brands have embraced the changes they needed to make to be unmissable. This is an ongoing journey and dependent on a whole host of elements and approaches according to the different subchannels (pure play or omnichannel) and modalities (delivery models such as click and collect). Each modality has its nuances and keeping these in mind allows our brands to come out on top with the customer algorithms, whether at an Amazon or a Walmart.
One thing’s for certain: having stock available to despatch immediately and an agile supply chain is key to competing across the different business models. That means accurate forecasting is critical, especially when coping with sudden spikes in shopper demand.
Which brands are leading the way?
To really push omni-commerce growth, the UK Foods team created a framework that allows them to make data-driven, consumer-centric decisions to prioritise which products to concentrate on and exactly what we need to do to make the most of each opportunity.
We’ve seen fantastic early results with the best-in-class launch in the US of the Melé skincare range from Beauty & Personal Care. Through a co-creation approach with melanin-rich consumers, this skincare brand has purpose at its heart, coupled with powerful digital commerce content to support its message. Earning organic media coverage and multiple online beauty awards, consumer sentiment speaks for itself with an average of 4.6-star reviews on Target.com.
After identifying a gap in the Turkish market, Yumoş pivoted from a softener brand into a clothes care brand. The team landed a well-executed launch, leveraging various media platforms to reach consumers. The campaign went viral, with Yumoş detergent virtual bundles becoming the best-selling bundle in the FMCG category in Trendyol, the country’s largest digital commerce platform.
In Vietnam, the Dove team truly exemplified the approach of designing specifically for digital commerce with a new face wash product range. They were able to launch in the right demand space at the right time, with fit-for-channel packaging. They optimised live streaming and partnered with over 120 key opinion leaders (KOLs) to promote the launch. Consumer sentiment was positive with 4.9-star reviews, achieving top ranking in Shopee’s ‘face cleanser’ category within four months.
We’ve also seen some great examples from China. For instance, the Comfort team are passionate about helping disadvantaged children in rural areas. To help raise awareness and donations, they teamed up with Viya – a hugely successful online influencer – to host charity sales on BAZAAR for a one-hour live streaming event. Also, Lux has partnered with Alibaba’s Tmall innovation centre. By using consumer insights, the team can test new product innovations before they are launched by optimising a mix of media and sampling. This led to the successful launch of the Lavie, a premium bath and body range.
What upcoming trends do we need to embrace?
In terms of new business models, it’s the two I have already mentioned. Outside China, social commerce is small but developing fast. In quick commerce, our ICNOW (Ice Cream NOW) team has done an incredible job building our presence in this channel, but over the last year the opportunity has spread to every category, which means we can build penetration and share across more brands.
Within our digital commerce landscape, we look to China to indicate the upcoming trends as our most mature market. This year, we saw our China team deliver the first-ever TikTok (Douyin) super brand day. The team elevated the shopping experience by leveraging a mix of KOLs and in-store livestreaming to recruit and engage shoppers. Partnerships with KOLs such as TikTok presenter Professor Liu and celebrities including popular talk show host Hu Lan provided an immersive, enjoyable and unique experience for consumers and highlighted that the growth in social commerce is only set to continue.
Sustainability is key. The channel has huge growth potential, but we need to consider the related impacts in terms of CO2 emissions from more delivery vans and packaging waste. We’re aiming to become an industry leader in this space so that, as the channel grows, we ensure our wider company commitments aren’t undone.
Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are becoming table-stakes. We are re-architecting our technology blueprint to consolidate existing tools and automate core business processes, so we can save to reinvest. We’re also testing AI for content to enhance the quality of our user experience, which in turn will boost sales. In digital commerce, we think in quarters not years, so as we move from start-up to scale-up, integrating digital commerce across the business is key.
What are the biggest obstacles to success?
Being such a rapidly expanding and ever-changing channel naturally brings challenges. However, this also provides many opportunities for us to become true pioneers.
Listening to consumers and building those relationships is a way to stay ahead of the curve. Having the data and insights to drive our decisions is essential, as well as being quick to pivot when, for example, something isn’t working. In digital commerce, you can fail fast, but it’s what you do with that learning that’s critical.
The continuing fragmentation of the landscape and business models means we must be ready to act fast, so we’re adopting new agile methods. We’ve seen some fantastic markets like Canada embrace this way of working to accelerate growth. And we have a new Home Care and Beauty & Personal Care end-to-end Digital Commerce team in the UK, focused on getting our product offerings exactly right.
The whole team’s hard work has delivered amazing results, but we have so much more scope and opportunity. This is an area that will continue to evolve fast. All of which makes it an incredibly exciting time to be working in digital commerce.

text Hand dishwashing liquid has a pretty tough job to do. It needs to remove grease and stains from cutlery, plates and pans while, at the same time, being gentle on the skin. That power comes from surfactants – the ingredients that make the product effective at foaming and cleaning. The problem is, surfactants are typically derived from virgin fossil fuels and therefore have a high carbon footprint.
Our Research & Development teams have been working to find an alternative that’s not only made using renewable ingredients but also offers the same – if not better – cleaning performance.
The result is a new formulation that’s three times more renewable and 99% biodegradable, using 100% plant-derived ingredients. Better yet, we have removed the use of fossil-derived chemicals. What’s more, the product is packaged in bottles made from 100% recycled plastic.
The product has hit the shelves in the Gulf region with our Lux brand (also known as Sunlight) and we’re now looking to roll it out to other countries.
Another step towards a cleaner future
In September last year, we launched our Clean Future strategy which, at its heart, has the ambition to replace 100% of the carbon derived from virgin fossil fuels in our cleaning and laundry product formulations with renewable or recycled carbon sources instead.
Central to that strategy is what we call the Carbon Rainbow. This describes how we will replace non-renewable fossil sources of carbon (also known as black carbon) with captured carbon (purple carbon), plants and biological sources (green carbon), marine sources such as algae (blue carbon), and carbon recovered from waste materials (grey carbon).
With the launch of this new formulation, we take another significant step forward in our Clean Future journey as it provides us with the base into which we can incorporate future technologies such as rhamnolipids. This is a type of surfactant found in nature. It’s 100% renewable and biodegradable, and importantly is also ultra-mild on skin, which sets it apart from other surfactant alternatives.
As Bert Nijhuis, Product Development Director, Home Care says: “With this latest innovation, our R&D team has created the optimal combination using 100% naturally derived, renewable cleaning ingredients while giving better performance than the conventional ingredients. This is a great example of the Carbon Rainbow in action – moving away from black carbon-sourced surfactants in favour of green carbon-sourced ones.”
text At the fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) this week in Nairobi, a historic agreement was announced to pave the way for a legally binding global treaty on plastic pollution.
The agreement opens the door for action to be taken across the full lifecycle of plastic, from manufacture to waste. It also means there are actions on product design for recycling and reuse. And in a truly breakthrough move, it recognises how the informal sector is vital in creating a circular economy for plastic.

The agreement sets up an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) where countries will formally meet to negotiate the details of the treaty. This will start soon, and the aim is to have an agreement ready for ratification in 2024. That is a hugely ambitious timeline and is a demonstration of the urgency that all UN member states see in addressing the problem.
“We welcome this landmark decision to begin forming a legally binding treaty to tackle plastic pollution,” says Ed Shepherd, Unilever’s Global Sustainability Senior Manager who’s been leading our advocacy work for the treaty. “The timescale of two years is unprecedented. But the scale and complexity of the problem are well understood. So it’s encouraging to see that there’s a real desire to fix it quickly and fix it for good.”
The hard work starts
With an ambitious timeframe to conclude negotiations by the end of 2024, a lot of the hard work now begins to look at the specifics of the treaty.
As we move forward with negotiations, we call on governments to be ambitious. We’re already signed up to voluntary industry agreements, including the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment (Opens in a pop-up window ) which aims to eradicate plastic waste and pollution at source, and various plastic pacts which bring together governments, NGOs and businesses to accelerate progress towards the reuse and repurposing of plastic. While these are working, they aren’t enough on their own. We need to go much further and we are pushing for a move to mandatory targets.

And we won’t press pause on our plastic reduction programme. As the treaty details are thrashed out over the next two years, we’ll continue working towards the 2025 plastic goals that we’ve already set ourselves: to halve the use of virgin plastic in our packaging – including an absolute reduction of 100,000 tonnes – and design all our packaging to be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable.
In fact, a global treaty will help us meet our goals by setting a common direction for all stakeholders and support solutions to scale through harmonisation of approaches and actions.
“This is a landmark decision by UN member states,” says Richard Slater, our Chief R&D Officer. “A legally binding treaty that addresses the full lifecycle of plastic will make a dramatic difference in the fight against plastic pollution. Tackling plastic pollution is not only the right thing to do, it’s also a catalyst for innovation and reflects what our consumers want – less plastic waste.
“With an ambition to conclude negotiations by the end of 2024, the hard work starts now to put in a place a robust plan to end plastic pollution.”

text You would think that a business that triples its turnover in under three years would be making headlines.
However, Unilever Professional (UPro), the professional arm of the company’s Home Care business group, and a Unilever self-built start-up, has been enjoying its impressive growth curve and quietly becoming a serious player in the professional cleaning space, largely unnoticed.
Until now.
“The way I see it, sometimes we pop the champagne too early,” says Deniz Yamanel, Unilever Professional Head of Marketing. “We know that the hardest part is the scaling up, building the portfolio, creating the content, creating the demand, and finding a route to market. But now I feel we have earned our stripes.”
Deniz Yamanel, Unilever Professional Head of Marketing 
Tapping into the huge potential of the B2B cleaning white space
It may still be a small business, but UPro has big ambitions. Committed to tapping into the huge potential offered by the B2B professional cleaning space which is estimated to hit an approximate $55billion by 2026, UPro is making the most of a buoyant market that has stabilised at a higher post-Covid baseline than expected. And with hygiene and safety remaining a big deciding factor for consumers in the out-of-home space, there is no sign of this upward trend slowing any time soon.
Present in 45 countries on six continents, UPro has successfully leveraged the power of Unilever’s Home Care brands and expertise to tap into an industry white space: small and medium-sized operators, such as food services and hotels too small to be serviced by big corporate hygiene companies.
How the #NotACoincidence mindset is fuelling growth
“Almost all our markets are growing double digit,” says Deniz. “We are the No.1 player in Brazil, and we are expecting strong growth in the future.”
These are impressive numbers, but all the more impressive when you consider that this has all been achieved with a slim portfolio of 40–50 products.
So far UPro has hit or surpassed most of its targets, and this Deniz insists is not a coincidence. “#NotACoincidence has become the team motto… but it is true, the success wasn’t an accident and if you put the right building blocks, it will come.”
#NotACoincidence has become the team motto… but it is true, the success wasn’t an accident and if you put the right building blocks, it will come.
Product, planet and people: Building blocks of success
For Deniz the first of these blocks is product. Despite a huge stable of market-leading Unilever home care products at their disposal, it became clear early on to the team that these would need to be re-engineered to meet the needs of the commercial operator.
“The requirements are so different,” explains Deniz. “In your kitchen, you can leave pots to soak overnight. In a professional kitchen, you need products that will get everything clean in time for the next shift. And then there is exposure to the product. In some markets, people are washing up for eight hours straight. The effect a dishwashing detergent has on your hands when you are washing up four plates is very different to when you are washing up for a restaurant.”
This is just one of the many insights to emerge from extensive research undertaken by UPro, focusing on the needs of their three priority sectors: laundrettes, hospitality and food services. Over 300 restaurant owners, cleaners and building service contractors contributed information that helped create a product portfolio tailor made to their needs.
“We then scoped which Unilever brand products offered the most opportunity,” explains Deniz. “These would be re-engineered before being tried and tested in target markets.
“The Perfect White laundry range, for example, was designed especially for hospitality and laundrettes. The full range of super-concentrated laundry products deliver unbeatable stain removal while guaranteeing the perfect white that guests expect and appreciate,” explains Deniz.
In fact, operator understanding is still key at UPro, with teams connecting weekly with operators around the globe to uncover pain points that can then be addressed through innovations and brand messaging.
A Clean Future portfolio
But it is not enough for products to clean well. In line with Unilever’s Clean Future initiative, products have to be kind to the planet as well. To this end, UPro continues to favour ‘no rinse’ cleaning products, laundry detergents that are effective at low temperatures and ‘no iron’ formulations, while also committing to increasing the amount of PCR and recyclable plastic in its packaging. 
People first and foremost
The third pillar of UPro’s approach is of course people. “At a time when cleaning has never been more important, cleaners are still undervalued,” says Deniz. “We are committed to changing that by putting the needs, safety and health of people who clean at the centre of everything we do.”
This philosophy can be seen at all levels of UPro’s activity, from creating formulations which reduce exposure to chemicals to colour coding products to help those who may not be able to read instructions.
“Research showed us, for instance, that in India, half of the people who work as cleaners were illiterate, so we used video models, icons and colour coding to help them get the best results safely,” explains Deniz.
The start-up mindset road to success
It has been an impressive few years for the business, but UPro is not resting on its laurels. More new product lines to tackle industry pain points are in the pipeline.
“I am really proud of what we have achieved, not least because this is a homegrown success story that we have built from the ground up,” says Deniz, reflecting that it is the team’s start-up mindset that has defined UPro’s hunger for growth.
“We are completely focused on how to best serve our customers,” she says. “But we also have a lot of fun.”
text Looking for a simple, actionable way to improve your health, lower your carbon footprint and help protect the planet for generations to come? Look no further than the food on your plate.
By choosing to eat more plant-based foods you can drastically lower your carbon footprint, conserve the world’s water supplies and help ensure that vital crop resources are fed to people, rather than livestock.
Sounds like a quick win, right? And the global appetite is there. Research by FMCG Gurus says 26% of global consumers are looking to increase their intake of plant-based foods, and 58% are doing so for the health of the planet. In the US alone, 97 million Americans reported following a plant-based diet in 2020, compared to just 290,000 in 2004. Analysts are bullish too, predicting 12% growth and estimating the market will be worth $74.2 billion by 2027.
But in order for the majority of the world to make that shift, eating plant-based needs to be affordable, easy, convenient and most of all – tasty too.
This is where Knorr can make a difference, championing a wider variety of foods grown in a sustainable way and using the power of flavour to overcome barriers that stop us from eating for good. “Our aim is to get food that’s good for people and the planet on seven billion plates by 2025,” says Knorr’s Global Brand Vice President April Redmond. “And we’re making progress; this year Knorr grew significantly. Today, nearly 15% of our products contain Future 50 Foods – ingredients that are nutritious, healthy and kind to the planet – by 2025, 25% of our foods will include Future 50 Foods and 50% will be plant based,” she says.
This growth has gone hand in hand with innovative products and solutions that make it easy for consumers to add, try, cook, swap or buy tasty plant-forward ingredients. On World Food Day, we celebrate three examples that are helping more households enjoy delicious planet-friendly dishes at mealtimes.
Unilever Food Solutions are working with caterers and industrial kitchens to develop recipes that see more plant-based food on menus 
Plates: Inspiring chefs to add sustainable ingredients to their menus
Encouraging food professionals from young chefs to blue-chip industrial caterers to add plant-forward dishes to their menus is just one of the jobs on the plate of Alex Hall, Executive Chef for Unilever Food Solutions, UK & Ireland. “It’s about ease as well as inspiration,” Alex says, “showing kitchens the benefits of simple, sustainable food swaps such as using sweet potato rather than potato or trying plant-based alternatives such as whipped tofu instead of whipped yoghurt,” he adds.
One of the initiatives Alex’s team is proud of is the series of recipes created by Knorr Professional chefs and nutritionists for Sodexo, one of the world’s biggest industrial caterers that feeds people at hospitals, offices and universities across the world, with thousands of locations in the US, France and the UK.
“We created a set of street food style recipes using Future 50 Foods ingredients such as lentils, spinach and kale in dishes such as curries, kebabs and tacos that people usually associate with meat. These were trialled in ‘Finer Diner’ pop-ups at five universities throughout the UK.
“It was great for Sodexo because the food and pop-up experience appealed to Gen Z who are increasingly turning towards vegan diets, and it’s another step forward in making plant-based food choices mainstream,” he says.
Products: Making plant-based a tasty and convenient option
Time constraints from work, childcare, and commuting mean there will be days when any time spent in the kitchen is too much time. In fact, the market for convenience foods and ready-to-eat meals is predicted to grow annually by 4.3% to 2026.
Finding ways to serve nutritious foods that save time in food prep and ensure plants are on the menu has led Knorr to develop products that suit the needs and tastebuds of the global markets they serve. In Turkey and France, it has seen the creation of Ezogelin soup and ‘Super Soups’ packed with nourishing and protein-rich lentils and quinoa. In Russia, easy-to-prep mini meals contain grains such buckwheat, spelt, sesame seeds, hemp seeds and flax seeds, while in the US, the world’s second-largest grower of spinach, Knorr has developed a wholegrain Spinach Florentine pasta that dishes up fibre, iron and minerals in minutes.
“With these products and recipes, Knorr is making eating plant-based foods convenient, simple and delicious. We are hopeful that this will help people move to a wider variety of plants and less meat,” says Dorothy Shaver, Global Marketing Sustainability Lead for Knorr.
Nopal, an edible cactus, is a Future 50 Food and one of the most searched-for recipe ingredients on Mexico’s popular recipe site Recepedia 
Platforms: The recipe site adding a Future 50 Foods twist to traditional dishes
Recepedia is a popular online destination for Mexican households looking for tasty meal ideas for every occasion. Earlier this year, to celebrate Knorr’s inaugural World Eat For Good Day, the site launched a selection of traditional recipes with a twist – a key ingredient was swapped for a Future 50 Food (F50F). Each recipe included information on the ingredient, including health benefits and its impact on the environment.
One of the site’s most popular recipes was the corn tortilla dish Chilaquiles verdes which got 116,488 page views and included sautéed nopal – an edible cactus from the same family as the prickly pear, which can be used as a green bean or green pepper replacement. The F50F recipes also spurred further search and demand for cactus recipes and other F50F ingredients, the most popular being spinach, cactus and quinoa.
On World Food Day, Knorr’s social platforms will celebrate recipes offering easy ways to incorporate some of these colourful characters into everyday dishes 
Making plant-forward choices easy today and everyday
“We believe nutritious and delicious food should be within the reach of everyone. Finding easy and tasty ways to do that is key and through Knorr’s platforms, recipes and products we aim to do that,” adds April.
And World Food Day is no exception. If all this food talk is making you hungry for sustainable change, check out our social feeds for more fun and inspiring recipes that will help you add plant-forward food, dishes and flavours to your plate.
text Getting the Global Goals done isn’t just about international initiatives or global commitments.
It’s also about tapping into the positive momentum and creative energy of young people in order to find quick-win, grassroot solutions.
To this end, in December 2020, Unilever – in partnership with Restless Development and Project Everyone – challenged young people around the world to hack solutions to some of the issues they saw around them. The issues included education, climate action, livelihoods, and more, and were covered in a series of online hackathons.
Ten months later, we are delighted to present the four winning #YouthPowerHack teams and their great ideas that are making a real difference to people every day, bringing us one step closer to achieving the Global Goals.

text Food production accounts for more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, is a leading cause of soil and species loss, and the No.1 user of water.
We need to grow food in ways that protect the planet and preserve precious resources. This means restoring and regenerating nature by lowering greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint), putting nutrients back into the soil, reusing and recycling water, and increasing living species below and above ground. This will, in turn, improve livelihoods and help safeguard the future of food.
That’s exactly what Knorr is doing with the launch of 50 regenerative agriculture projects over the next five years.
These will put our Regenerative Agriculture Principles into practice by experimenting with new methods to grow and diversify food. Learnings and insights will be shared with others – growers, processors and our peers – to help drive the transformation in the way food is grown for the benefit of people and the planet.
The projects build on more than a decade of Knorr’s collaboration with farmers and suppliers, which has led to 95% of its vegetables and herbs now being sustainably sourced, globally. We estimate that combined they will lower Knorr’s key ingredients’ greenhouse gas emissions and water use by around 30% while improving biodiversity, soil health and livelihoods.
It’s a key step in Knorr’s journey to reinvent food for humanity with the ambition to get food that’s good for people and the planet on 7 billion plates by 2025.
“We need to work with nature and ecosystems, not against them,” says Hanneke Faber, President of our Foods and Refreshment division. “Earlier this year we launched Unilever’s Regenerative Agriculture Principles to support the growing of food with a positive impact on nature. Now Knorr is putting the principles to the test, and sharing learnings as we go along so that everyone can do the same.”
This initiative is a part of the Unilever Climate & Nature Fund and our wider commitment to help protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030.
text The eyes of the world will be on Paris from 30 November, as world leaders gather for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). Their aim is to achieve a legally binding agreement on how to address the issue together for the first time.
Unilever is joining legions of individuals and organisations in calling for ambitious action. Now we’re announcing new targets that we hope will encourage others to do the same, and give confidence to leaders attending Paris that business supports and is planning for an accelerated decarbonisation of the economy.
Good for business, good for the world
Climate change and the devastation it causes matter to our business and our consumers. The business case for action is clear. Achieving this goal by 2030 will reap many benefits, including a lower operational cost, greater resilience in terms of our energy supply and a closer relationship with consumers.
Earlier this year, we were part of the B Team’s call for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In line with this call, our membership of the RE100 initiative and our commitment to adopting science-based targets, we want to go further and faster in the areas over which we have direct control.
Unilever will be ‘carbon positive’ by 2030. It means 100% of our energy across our operations will come from renewable sources, and with partners we will directly support the generation of more renewable energy than we need for our own operations, making the surplus available to the markets and communities in which we operate.
Minimising our environmental impact while continuing to grow the business was written into our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan when it was launched five years ago. This is the first time we have put a deadline on our ambition of sourcing 100% renewable energy for our operations, and it goes further than we have previously stated.
Stepping up with stretching targets
We recognise that our success depends in part on the broader changes taking place in energy markets worldwide.
This new target is just one part of our strategy, and we will continue to drive transformational change to eliminate deforestation from global supply chains, support mainstream sustainable agriculture, advocate for public policy to tackle climate change and help consumers to use less water and less energy and to recycle more.
We have developed these stretching targets with the support of the independent global non-profit organisation, Forum for the Future and will continue to work collaboratively with partners, suppliers and others to achieve our goal.
Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said: “The Paris climate talks represent a window of opportunity – but they are the start rather than the end of the journey. We all have a responsibility to act now by turning aspirations into practical solutions. That’s why today we are stepping up our own efforts by announcing that Unilever will be ‘carbon positive’ by 2030, eliminating fossil fuels from our business and directly supporting the generation of more renewable energy than we consume. Let’s make future generations proud of what we’ve achieved.”
“A stable climate in which to flourish”
Sally Uren, CEO at Forum for the Future, which helped Unilever develop these stretching targets, said: “The Paris climate talks come at a unique moment in which businesses are facing unprecedented risks from dangerous climate change, as well as immense potential benefits in avoiding it.
“Leading corporations are recognising the fact that individual action alone won't be enough to avert the massive threats that unmitigated climate change poses for business and society. We need to see more pioneering businesses such as Unilever advocate for a deal in Paris that will give them and the rest of society a stable climate in which to flourish.”
Unilever’s ‘carbon positive’ goal in full
We will become ‘carbon positive’ in our operations by 2030. To do this, we will:
Source 100% of our total energy across our operations from renewable sources by 2030
Source all our electricity purchased from the grid from renewable sources by 2020
Eliminate coal from our energy mix by 2020
And in order to achieve our target of ‘carbon positive’ by 2030, we intend to directly support the generation of more renewable energy than we consume and make the surplus available to the markets and communities in which we operate.
text Ending deforestation and speeding up environmental restoration are crucial if we intend to limit climate change and protect global biodiversity. Using data and technological solutions could help us to achieve these goals, especially when it comes to creating traceability and transparency in the first mile of our supply chain.
But despite real progress by many stakeholders, the collection methods and technical standards of these datasets are often being developed and managed in a fragmented way. This is creating competing versions of what’s happening on the ground and delaying action against deforestation. We want to change this.
At COP26, Unilever, together with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Resources Institute (WRI), the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Google, announced the creation of the Forest Data Partnership.
Building a consensus to build a solution
The coalition will create a unified framework, allowing everyone access to consistent, open-source and validated geospatial data. It will offer the world a more uniform way to monitor, verify and disclose progress in reducing deforestation and restoring degraded land.
The new data ecosystem will focus on key regions, including the Amazon Basin, South-East Asia and West Africa. For it to work, it needs to be a truly collaborative project, so we will be actively recruiting committed companies, national and sub-national governments, NGOs and research partners, and, most importantly, communities in tropical landscapes to join the team. The aim is to create a consensus around this data ecosystem as the core knowledge base for all stakeholders, so that we can stop deforestation faster and restore forests quicker.
USAID will provide US$13.7 million in funding for the initiative. FAO and WRI will lead the development of the data ecosystem by bringing together key public and private sector stakeholders. This will be supported by NASA’s SERVIR initiative, which builds capacity to use geospatial data at national and regional levels. As the key technological partner, Google will provide a platform for the work to live on and Unilever will serve as the private sector lead.
Our place in the partnership
As a major purchaser of commodities, we know that the way we buy our resources and the standards we set ourselves can have a positive impact. We have a goal – a completely deforestation-free supply chain by 2023 – and we believe technology will be critical in generating the transparency and traceability needed to make a difference on the ground.
Together with our partners at Google Earth Engine, Descartes Labs, Orbital Insight, NGIS and Earthqualizer, we are already steadily working towards this goal. Our own internal no-deforestation dashboard has recently gone live, and thanks to the datasets we have already been able to gather from our technological partners, we have just published our first forest footprint report, focused on the Aceh Province of Indonesia. Our intention is to continue these deep dives into other portions of our supply chain, so we can build a detailed picture of what’s happening on the ground and act accordingly.
We are concentrating our sourcing into a core set of supply chain partners, from tier-one suppliers down to palm oil mills, as well as ensuring that our sourcing expands to include more independent mills and smallholders. And beyond our own supply chain, we are working with our partner WWF in landscapes like in Sabah, Malaysia, to drive broader change across deforestation-heavy industries. Together, we have now launched five jurisdictional programmes across Indonesia and Malaysia. 
All of this has been instrumental in positioning us as the business lead for the Forest Data Partnership, and we are proud to be a part of such a significant new tool in the fight against deforestation.
By working together and creating this ecosystem, we can take meaningful and progressive action to halt deforestation, to reduce emissions and to provide tangible benefits to both people and nature. It has been said that we can only manage what we can measure. Now, with the help of recent technological developments, the boundaries of what we can measure have lifted and there’s no excuse not to act.
Building our framework
The key aims of the coalition’s framework will be to:
Align with key stakeholders to identify the system’s main needs and to build consensus around data gaps (for example, data on forest carbon, peatlands or planted palm)
Innovate to solidify a broad consensus around existing data and to accelerate the development of new datasets
Deploy data in actionable and effective ways
Assess and communicate lessons learned from effective interventions.
text Innovation is at the heart of our growth. It’s how we design, produce and market everyday products that bring real benefits to people against genuine needs and pain-points, and deliver more sustainable solutions without compromising on performance.
Recently, we’ve been transforming how we innovate. We’re shifting our approach to work on fewer, bigger innovation activities – executed with more discipline – and focus on the fastest-growing consumer and channel spaces.
This is resulting in a stronger innovation funnel for our biggest brands to transform the core, premiumise their offering and access high-growth spaces. Here are just a few of many examples.
Our most effective deodorant yet
80% of people are let down by their deodorant, because ordinary antiperspirants can’t always keep up with their busy lives. To tackle this, we launched our most effective deodorant yet. Rexona’s patented technology provides 72 hours of sweat and odour protection – a microtechnology innovation brought together by over 50 expert scientists. We’re the global category leader in deodorants and Rexona – also known as Degree and Sure – is the world’s No.1 deo brand.
A zero salt stock cube
With many people eating over twice the recommended daily amount of salt, consumer interest in reduced salt or sodium products is growing fast. At our Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands, our experts came up with the world’s first zero salt range of stock cubes. Traditionally, salt is used to form the cube’s structure, holding all the other ingredients together. 
To create the Knorr zero salt stock cube, the R&D team ran thousands of virtual experiments in parallel, with multiple combinations of ingredients to find the optimal balance of taste, texture and nutrition. Launched in 2020 and now scaled to ten markets, it’s just one of the many steps our largest food brand is taking to help consumers transition to healthier diets.
Leave-on skin care benefits in a wash-off product
Early in 2022, Dove launched its biggest formula improvement in six years: our new Dove Body Wash, with clinically proven superior moisturisation and care. It has a patented technology at its core, along with an ultra-mild, microbiome-friendly formulation, that brings leave-on skin care benefits to a wash-off product. By delivering better on core consumer benefits with our biggest brand and in key markets – and with sustainability built in through its 98% biodegradable formulation – the launch is proving to be one of our most successful ever.
The growing need for plant-based ingredients
If the world’s food system is to cope with population growth and climate change, plant-based foods must be higher on the menu. Dairy-free, vegan and meat alternatives – high growth and premium segments – are a key focus. One particularly successful innovation in this space is Hellmann’s Vegan Mayonnaise which is now available in 33 markets (and counting) and is the No.1 vegan mayonnaise in the UK, Canada, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Czech Republic and Netherlands. And food isn’t the only application for plant-based ingredients. We’re also introducing 100% renewable and biodegradable plant-based polymers in our laundry detergents.
Advanced tech behind a beauty revolution
Over recent years, we’ve developed more than 40 technologies for our Prestige Beauty business, which is growing fast with a turnover of €1 billion in 2021. One of our most recent is Hourglass Red 0. This is the first vegan alternative to the most commonly used red pigment in colour cosmetics – red carmine, which is derived from female beetles and can take 1,000 beetles for one lipstick. This was a multi-year development, heavily dependent on digital, virtual experiments.
A key launch in a fast-growing segment
Dove Hair Therapy is a key launch for us in a segment – premium hair – which is growing at 30%. Its formula includes state-of-the-art skin care ingredients (such as hyaluronic acid and vitamin B3) to deliver product performance that’s superior to higher-priced luxury brands, with 97% less breakage after just one use. This product was launched exclusively in the US and we’re in the process of rolling it out to other markets.
text When it comes to pollination, nothing beats the humble bumble bee.
Fertilising a third of the food we eat and 80% of flowering plants, bees and other pollinating insects have a global economic value of around £120 billion (€141 billion).
For Unilever, almonds, tomatoes and mustard seeds are just some of the hundreds of bee-dependent crops essential to our business.
Ensuring our farms are future fit means empowering farmers and smallholders in our supply chain to protect and regenerate the land they are cultivating through agricultural practices that have a positive effect on soil health, water and air quality, carbon capture and biodiversity.
Which is where bees come in. As an indicator species for the health of the ecosystems they live in, their presence, or absence, will indicate just how much impact these regenerative agricultural practices are making. If bees are flourishing, then so are the natural habitats in which they live.
"We have thousands of supply chains and hundreds of crop species that depend on pollination That is why, over the last decade, we have been committed to finding nature-led solutions that protect biodiversity."
Andrea Granier, Sustainable Sourcing Manager at Unilever.
Bees are in trouble
Increasingly, however, bees are not flourishing. Habitat loss and pollution are just a few factors contributing to the collapse of bee populations around the world. And they are not alone. Close to 35% of invertebrate pollinators, including bees and butterflies, and about 17% of vertebrate pollinators, such as bats, face extinction globally.
“We have thousands of supply chains and hundreds of crop species that depend on pollination,” says Andrea Granier, Sustainable Sourcing Manager at Unilever. “That is why, over the last decade, we have been committed to finding nature-led solutions that protect biodiversity.”
Small projects with huge potential
It is also why Unilever created the Regenerative Agriculture Principles: a new approach to farming that works in harmony with nature to ensure the long-term viability and resilience of the earth’s biodiversity.
The principles highlight the five priority areas where we can achieve the biggest impact: soil, water, carbon, livelihoods and biodiversity.
The principles are built on the learnings from a decade of experience working to protect bees and biodiversity, and provide the foundations for future regenerative agriculture projects.
“Until now we have worked on testing methods and ideas with suppliers,” says Andrea. “We have a huge diversity of crops in a multitude of landscapes and geographies in our supply chain, so we have had to work on small-scale projects that are adapted to each case. These have allowed us to discover nature-led systems that work.
“Thanks to this work, we are now ready to work at scale. In many ways, our work with bees offers a bridge between what we have been doing and what we will do in the future,” he adds.
As Unilever’s biggest food brand, Knorr’s Partnership Fund has been leading the way – supporting farmers to invest in sustainable solutions. To date there are over 20 projects in 11 countries, involving 2,300 hectares of land and representing an investment of €347,000.
Here are some of the future fit projects that are already making a difference.
Colman’s mustard, UK
Like 80% of flowering plants, the white mustard we use to make Colman’s mustards depends on pollinators. So when a survey revealed gaps in the availability of nectar during late spring and early autumn in our suppliers’ fields in England, Unilever partnered with the English Mustard Growers organisation to plant 500 bee-friendly hedges and spring-flowering bulbs.
“Having the farmers collaborate on this project means they are able to analyse their land holistically, benefiting pollinators on a much larger scale,” says Giulia Stellari, Unilever’s Director of Sustainable Sourcing. “This will also help secure the supply of crops used in our Colman’s English mustard and therefore its provenance, as well as support our wider ecosystem and biodiversity.”
D. Nomikos tomatoes, Greece
Agricultural intensification is a major factor in the decline of the global bee population. D. Nomikos, our tomato supplier in Greece, is working to attract more pollinators. To this end, ten farmers in Thessaly have agreed to plant bee-friendly flower borders around their tomato fields, and to position nests in such a way as to attract more birds that feed on crop-harming insects. “This is the future of farming,” says tomato farmer, Akrivousis Alexandros.
Knorr vegetables, France
Ecosystems are delicate. Take one element out of the chain and the whole system ceases to flourish. In our suppliers’ vegetable fields in Marchais in northern France, for example, farming has depleted the wildflower population, leading to a loss of pollinators. It has also led to reduction of insects which grey partridges depend on for food, leading to a 44% reduction in their population. To help remedy this situation, we have been working with five of our partners and planting 2.85 hectares of flower strips around the vegetable fields in order rebalance the ecosystem and attract pollinators, insects and the wildlife that depends on them.
Bee hotel created by Agraz, Spain
Intensive agriculture and the use of pesticides had led to a decrease in useful insects such as bees.
In order to make their tomato farm more attractive to pollinators and other insects, our tomato supplier, Agraz, based in Badajoz in south-west Spain, installed ‘bug hotels’. Made from twigs, leaves and branches, they offer the perfect shelter for insects, encouraging them to stay on the farm, pollinate and keep the pests at bay.
“In addition to improving the pollination process because of the increase in bees, the hotels have also attracted other beneficial insects to our farms, which has reduced the need for pesticides,” says Jose Manuel Esteban, Sustainability Manager at Agraz.
text In the UK and Ireland, our Colman’s brand has moved to recyclable paper-based packaging for its dry Meal Maker and Sauces range.
The innovative pouches – developed in partnership with Mondi, a global leader in sustainable packaging solutions – are made using a paper-based, aluminium-free material that can easily be sorted for recycling at home. The packs carry the OPRL * (On-Pack Recycling Label) logo, which is widely recognised by UK consumers.
Our R&D team collaborated closely with Mondi’s throughout the development process, including overcoming the challenge of limited access to production facilities due to Covid-19. After we came up with a proof of concept, we conducted extensive line trials at both our pilot plants. This allowed us to quickly prototype and test the new material before scaling up. The whole process, from development to implementation, took just over a year.
The paper-based packaging will initially be rolled out across Colman’s Sausage Casserole flavour, with the full range set to have moved to the new material next year.
This project covers a product portfolio which uses about 220 tonnes of packaging material annually. While the quantity of material is important, the main breakthrough is that the new pack can go into the UK’s household paper waste stream. This means it is sorted at the consumer’s home and therefore has a more realistic chance of being recycled.
“At Colman’s, we’re big and bold when it comes to our flavours, and we’re keen to make equally bold steps when it comes to our sustainability commitments,” says Fikerte Woldegiorgis, Foods Marketing Director for Unilever UK & Ireland. “The new packaging ensures that shoppers can enjoy the great-tasting product they know and love, with the added benefit of being able to recycle the packs.”
Now more than ever, Colman’s believes it’s important to offer easy solutions to add flavour to meals but in a more sustainable way, with 87% (Nielsen, 2021) of consumers saying that recyclable packaging is the most important sustainability attribute they look for when buying a food or drink product.
This latest move by Colman’s is part of our wider global packaging commitments which include targets to halve our use of virgin plastic and make all our packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.
text The human body is an incredibly complex ecosystem. Recent studies suggest that for every human cell in our bodies, there is at least one bacterial cell either on our skin or inside us too. 1
This enormous community of bacteria is part of an army of micro-organisms that together make up our gut microbiome and they have been shown to influence our health in many ways, including our metabolism, our susceptibility to disease and our immune response.
Now evidence is emerging to suggest the gut microbiome can also have an impact on our mental health and wellbeing. For example, 90% of our mood-elevating serotonin is found in our gut, 2 highlighting the link between our gut and our brain. This connection is known as the gut–brain axis and we’re partnering with the biotechnology experts at Holobiome to explore the relationship further.
Gut feelings
The gut–brain axis allows communication between the gut and the brain via neurotransmitters – tiny chemical messengers that can have a stimulating or calming effect on the body. Through its research, Holobiome has identified the specific gut bacteria that naturally produce these neurotransmitters.
Working together, our research partnership aims to use this expertise to identify the ingredients these bacteria prefer to interact with. Our long-term ambition is to add these ingredients to some of the foods and refreshment products in Unilever’s portfolio to naturally boost levels of calming neurotransmitter in the gut, creating a positive impact on our mental wellbeing.
“More than 70% of consumers are concerned that stress and anxiety are having a moderate or severe impact on their health. To help combat this, consumers are increasingly seeking food and drink products that can have a positive impact on their overall health and mental wellbeing,” says Carla Hilhorst, Executive Vice President, R&D, Foods & Refreshment at Unilever. “This research offers exciting opportunities for our future food and drink formulations, enabling us to deliver healthier products.”
As part of our Future Foods ambition, we’re already working hard to transform the global food system for the better. We’re committed to doubling the number of our products delivering positive nutrition globally by 2025, and our partnership with Holobiome will help us to make healthier options more accessible for everyone.
text 90% of children who took part in a new Domestos survey said they had been impacted emotionally and physically by the poor state of their school toilets.
However, only one in six had told a parent about it.
These are just some of the key findings from ‘The School Toilet Report’, a new study commissioned by Domestos, published today. 
Based on research with over 4,000 parents and over 3,800 children living in Poland, the UK, India and South Africa, the report highlights the fact that poorly maintained school toilets are not only making children unhappy – they are limiting their school achievement and wellbeing.
“As an individual who has been engaged in sanitation issues for many years, this report makes challenging reading,” says Madhusudhan Rao, Domestos EVP of Home and Hygiene. “We knew that children were suffering, but the sheer prevalence and scale of these issues for our young people shows the need for urgent and immediate action.”
An invisible, international problem that is damaging children’s wellbeing
Significantly, the survey highlighted that children in all four countries were facing similar issues with school sanitation:
73% reported cleanliness as an issue, including unflushed toilets, wet floors and urine or faeces on the seat or floor
89% said that their toilets were ‘neglected’, with missing or broken items
78% felt unsafe using school toilets due to poor lighting or lack of doors and gates.
The survey also revealed that dirty school toilets were affecting children’s wellbeing and making them adopt unhealthy habits:
30% reported ‘discomfort’ and ‘finding it hard to concentrate in class’, due to ‘holding it in’ to avoid using school toilets
12% said that they deliberately did not eat or drink at school to order to avoid using the toilet
One in ten admitted missing school to avoid using toilets.
The findings also highlighted a consistent disconnect between parental expectations and the realities faced by their children. Despite the overwhelmingly negative experience of most children surveyed, 80% of parents rated their child’s school toilets as ‘good’.
A wake-up call for us all to act now
“The findings of this study must act as a wake-up call for us all – governments, donor agencies, NGOs, teachers and parents – to redouble the efforts to ensure every school is able to provide clean and usable toilets,” says Professor Kwame Akyeampong, Professor of International Education and Development at the Open University and a key contributor to ‘The School Toilet Report’.
To this end, Domestos will be using the findings of ‘The School Toilet Report’ to better inform our work, such as the Cleaner Toilets, Brighter Futures programme. Together with a variety of partners, including development agencies and government departments of education, Domestos will continue its focus on improving school sanitation globally. Through these initiatives, Domestos has already helped 29 million people gain better access to clean and safe toilets. Now this target has been reset to 100 million more people by 2030.
Let’s Talk School Toilets
The fact that only 15% of children surveyed had told an adult about the poor state of their school toilets reflects the invisibility of the problem and the need to talk about it with the people most concerned – namely children.
Recognising that this may not always be an easy topic of conversation, Domestos has teamed up with parenting expert and influencer Clemmie Telford to create the ‘Let’s Talk School Toilets’ guide to help parents and children talk more openly about toilets at school.
“Some memories of my own school toilets aren’t nice, and I assumed that they would be better for children nowadays. Domestos’ research suggests that, sadly, this isn’t the case,” says Clemmie.
The guide includes tips to help parents understand the realities their children are facing, making the ‘school toilet talk’ that bit easier.
Clemmie suggests that simple things like finding the right time to chat and talking about how you approach toilet hygiene at home can help open up a conversation with your child and create an environment where issues can be discussed and problems solved.
“It's definitely something I intend to keep talking to my kids about,” says Clemmie. “I am encouraging you all to have this conversation, too, to find out what’s going on and start to improve the situation for all kids.”

text ‘A breath of fresh air’ is a common expression but, for many children, fresh air is a rare commodity.
Clean air is certainly at a premium these days, with recent international research indicating that nine in ten children are breathing toxins well above safe levels. UNICEF has warned that by 2050, the leading cause of child mortality will be linked to air pollution and yet the right to clean air is not protected in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Research reveals generalised worry about air pollution among children
It is an omission that many children feel strongly about. Of the 4,000 questioned as part of a recent international YouGov poll commissioned by Blueair/GAP, 94% said they believed it was their right to breathe clean air.
Nine-year-old Mathilda, from London, voiced the general sentiment when she remarked: “It isn’t fair that some children have more clean air than others.”
And nine-year-old Yash, from Delhi, agrees. “Everyone has the right to clean air,” he says.
Air pollution and children – a toxic combination
The fact that despite the pandemic, over 67% of the children questioned were still worried about how air pollution would affect their health, bears testimony to how serious their concerns are. And according to a respiratory specialist, Professor Sir Stephen Holgate, they have very valid reasons to worry. “Children’s developing organs and immune systems make them especially vulnerable to dirty air,” he explains.
“As they grow, they continue to be at high risk from air pollution because their immune systems, lungs and brains are still developing. Every day, around 93% of the world’s children (under the age of 15) are breathing air so polluted that it poses serious risks to their health and development.”
A cleaner future for kids
However, the research did provide some good news. Despite their concerns about air pollution, most of the children expressed a desire and a commitment to do something about it. “We actually do have the power as a lot of people listen to kids,” says eight-year-old Hugo from London.
It is to support children like Hugo, Yash, Mathilda and countless others that our brand Blueair – specialists in creating high-quality, award-winning air purifiers – have teamed up with sustainability charity Global Action Plan and launched the Freedom to breathe campaign demanding that the UN make clean air a universal right for children.
Sara Alsén, Chief Purpose Officer at Blueair, says: “For the last 25 years, Blueair has been fighting for every child’s right to breathe clean air. By teaming up with civil society actors who share our belief that it’s time to make access to clean air – like access to clean water – the right of every child, we are bringing our founder’s purpose to life.”
Educating children, engaging the world
The campaign is working with local NGO partners to deliver information in schools in the world’s four worst-affected cities: Delhi, London, Beijing and Los Angeles. They will teach children not only about the dangers of air pollution but also how best to protect themselves from it.
Concurrently, the campaign is working to amplify the voices of young people by asking everyone to petition the UN and demand that a child’s right to clean air be enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Sonja Graham, CEO at Global Action Plan, reflects: “Children have the right to clean water and a safe home. Why do they not have the right to breathe clean air?”
Children everywhere should have the right to clean air
text Artificial intelligence (AI) is regularly cast as the villain of the workplace. The truth is more nuanced. Yes, smart tech solutions like AI are on the rise. Yet, on the flip side, today’s digital workplace is also driving opportunities for new skills and career options.
A quick ‘what if’... consider smart tech: what if AI was also seen as a positive facilitator of new career opportunities?
The World Economic Forum’s Retail, Consumer Goods and Lifestyle group recently put precisely that question to one of its business-led taskforces – co-led by Unilever and US retailer Walmart.
“Reskilling and upskilling are often seen as a time-consuming and costly exercise by businesses, so we were interested to find out if data and AI could help in some way and, if so, what future redeployment journeys might look like,” says Patrick Hull, Unilever Vice President, Future of Work.
Job skills pilot project
In search of answers, we recently embarked on a three-month research project with our taskforce partner Walmart.
To assist with the research process, we brought on consultancy firm Accenture and Canadian start-up SkyHive, an expert in workplace analytics.
Two propositions framed our approach. First, that jobs might be better viewed as a combination of multiple skills, rather than singular roles. Second, that data could potentially augment human perceptions about the skills required for specific roles.
The second idea came from SkyHive. When the AI specialist used its data-driven technology to analyse job-specific skills, it identified an average of 34 skills per person in a role. However, employees often downplay the number of skills they have, typically putting the figure at 11.
There’s another intrinsic benefit of a more data-driven approach to reskilling and redeployment: the elimination of preconceptions, reports Nicholas Whittall, Accenture’s Managing Director of Talent & Organisation/Human Potential.
As he notes: “AI eliminates human bias that recruiters or managers often hold in terms of who’s truly capable of doing which job.”
Skill pathways
By way of a baseline, the HR teams at Unilever and Walmart selected ten different roles from across their respective businesses.
Each team then drew up a list of the main skills they associated with each role and the potential training pathways for reskilling people for different roles.
Accenture and SkyHive then reviewed the lists and subjected them to a variety of data analytics tools. Their objectives: to see what skills might be missing, to spot where skills overlapped, and to determine the most efficient way to upskill our existing talent.
By breaking roles down into their component parts and analysing them in granular detail, the skills gaps between different functions emerged as far less wide than initially thought.
Take two jobs that, on the face of it, may have little in common: an inventory replenishment manager and an eCommerce manager. The data shows that there’s actually a 63% crossover in skillsets.
“What the pilot has taught us is that AI and data analytics give us solid grounds for having an optimistic view about the future of work and the opportunities for reskilling,” Patrick observes.
Becoming future fit
Our hope is that other companies from the consumer goods sector will add their own case studies to the research (the key learnings of which are below).
In the long run, our ambition is that the findings will move from the hypothetical to the practical, informing how HR professionals address the pressing skills challenges faced by businesses.
“Focusing on expanding opportunities for growth for our own people is front and centre of our Future-Fit strategy. We know that if they grow, then our business also grows,” Patrick notes.
“Giving our people the training to fill internal skills gaps is good for them and for our business. If data and AI can help us do that better, as this initial pilot indicates it can, then great, let’s use it.”
As the research pilot goes forward, Patrick is confident that the role of tech will increasingly be seen as a friend, not a foe, of today’s fast-moving world of work and skills.
Key Learnings: Future Skills Pilot Report
Skilling is just smart business: preparing existing employees for new roles is often the quickest and most cost-effective solution to filling skills gaps.
HR must empower individual talent mobility: emerging data and AI-driven technology can support HR’s efforts to equip people to build and shape their careers.
AI is essential for eliminating bias: machine-learning offers an objective, equitable means of creating new or potentially overlooked job pathways.
A culture change is required: upskilling needs to be seen as a competitive advantage or as a business imperative.
Cross-industry collaboration is an accelerator: preparing people for the future of work has to be a collective effort; no individual company can do it alone.
text The 2015 Paris Agreement was a defining moment in the fight against climate change. Together, the world agreed we must keep the global temperature rise well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Since then, it has become clear that limiting warming to 1.5°C is the only way to avoid a climate catastrophe.
COP26, the next global climate conference, to be held in Glasgow later this month, will be another key moment. It is an opportunity to turn the Paris Agreement into action: for governments, business, and civil society to come together and to put in more of the groundwork that will make climate action happen quickly.
For the sake of people and planet, this is an opportunity everyone must seize. And as a principal partner of COP26, our hope is that we can use our voice and influence to help accelerate climate action globally.
Businesses and governments must do much more, now
Businesses everywhere should be setting net zero goals now, with action plans and milestones, reporting on their progress, and engaging with suppliers, investors, and governments.
By helping to drive a faster transition to low-carbon, resilient economies, businesses can empower policymakers to be more ambitious. In turn, by creating the right combination of incentives, policies and frameworks, governments will help to propel business action to get the world on track to 1.5°C.
We want to see regulation to phase out coal and other fossil fuels, a price on carbon that reflects its true cost to society and nature, and a switch to renewable energy and electric vehicles. This should be coupled with an immediate roll- out of nature-based solutions and policies, which have a huge role to play in limiting warming to 1.5°C.
So ahead of COP26, every government needs to set a stretching climate target, which will help halve global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 at the latest. And share a pathway for how they will reach it.
We also need governments to protect people and livelihoods by providing support for developing countries, and climate finance to help people adapt and build resilience to climate change impacts. These impacts are already being felt everywhere and many of them are likely to continue or get worse, even in a 1.5°C future.
Doing all that we can within our own organisation
Protecting the planet is the right thing to do. It also makes good financial sense for business.
We know our consumers expect to see climate leadership and from the materials we source to the product information we share, we’ll do our best to help them to make sustainable choices. Which is why we’re making sure that as an organisation we’re doing as much as we can to tackle climate change within our own backyard.
We published our Climate Transition Action Plan (PDF | 11MB) to be transparent about our approach and to encourage other companies to follow.
Led by climate science, our ambitious climate goals include having emissions-free operations by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions in our value chain by 2039. We’re switching to 100% renewable energy and electric vehicles, and working with our suppliers and innovation partners to scale up solutions that protect people and planet.
We also know that biodiversity loss and climate change are deeply interconnected. Actions that allow nature to flourish will also benefit climate, and vice versa, and so must be tackled at the same time. So we’re ending deforestation in our supply chain, preserving water, and regenerating agriculture.
Everything is connected
While we work to lower our own emissions and engage our suppliers to take action too, the lion’s share of our value chain emissions falls outside our direct control.
We’re inextricably linked to the wider world around us – from the way our employees commute to work, to the energy consumed while using our products and the recycling facilities available to our end consumers.
We know we can’t do it alone. So in two weeks’ time, our brands and our people will be at COP26 in Glasgow, fighting for bolder and faster action. Because the planet’s future, and our own futures, depend on it. Are you joining the fight?
text Stella Constantatos, Senior Manager in the Business Operations Sustainability team at Unilever 
Our Climate Transition Action Plan sets out the steps the company will take to achieve net zero across our value chain by 2039. As Climate Week NYC draws to a close, Stella Constantatos, Senior Manager in the Business Operations Sustainability team at Unilever, talks about why it’s critically important for us to look outside our own walls and engage our suppliers on climate.
How did you start working on sustainability and climate change?
I joined Unilever at a Home Care factory in South Africa in a process engineering role, producing soap powder more than 20 years ago. After a while, I wanted to work on something that had a positive impact on the environment. Through stints in manufacturing and logistics, supply chain and procurement, with 15 of my 20 or so years focused on sustainability, I developed a good grounding for the role I’m in now.
What does your current role involve?
I lead the work on our upstream emissions. Just over 60% of our total greenhouse gas footprint arises upstream of our operations, which covers all the raw materials and packaging – grown, extracted or refined, and processed – that arrive at our factory gates.
My day-to-day job is a mix of internal and external interfaces. There’s a lot we need to do internally with our procurement organisation. For example, we’re looking at how we can leverage our buying power to drive impact when we buy a chemical or a commodity. There’s also a big external part, which I love, dealing with our suppliers directly. At the moment, we’re in the middle of a pilot of the Unilever Climate Programme, working with over 30 of our suppliers – a small but important subset of the 54,000 suppliers we buy materials and services from. We’re figuring out ways to improve transparency of climate impact and ultimately reduce emissions from our shared value chain.
Why is it so important to help suppliers reduce their emissions?
Unilever has been acting in this space for a couple of decades, and we believe it’s absolutely relevant for our consumers and other stakeholders and for the longevity of our business.
We’ve seen disruption to our value chain in the past due to extreme weather events, and this is only going to worsen with climate change if we – and other companies and parts of society – don’t move fast enough. We need to tackle emissions in our supply chain to ensure the future security of supply. And we have to do this by working with others, because we won't be able to achieve our goals on our own.
We’re not directly in control of what suppliers do – we can only influence them. So, we’ve spent quite a bit of time looking into the materials and the services that Unilever buys, to identify the most important ones for us to focus on. That’s how we’ve arrived at a target of 300 suppliers we want to work with to accelerate their climate journey. These suppliers effectively cover 60% of our upstream emissions.
What are we asking our suppliers to do?
Three things. One is to set a climate target in line with what the science says is needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees – namely, to halve emissions by 2030. We’re also asking them to publicly report on their progress for accountability. And the third, and probably most important thing, is that they share the carbon footprint of the materials they sell to us.
Being able to understand the source of emissions and look at the scenarios to reduce them and then work out the trajectory over time is very powerful. We believe that when you know the footprint of the material you are producing as a supplier, then you can dig into where your biggest source of emissions is, and you know where you need to act.
What are we doing to support our suppliers?
The suppliers currently working with us in our pilot are a very diverse group, covering different sectors of the economy and ranging from small, privately owned enterprises through to very large corporations, bigger than ours in some cases, and they are scattered all over the world.
They are also all at different stages of their climate journey. Some are really advanced and we can learn a lot from them. Then, at the other end of the scale, we have suppliers who have not started acting on climate yet. And this is a real challenge, because we’ve had to adapt our engagement approach depending on what stage these suppliers are at. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t cut it.
For those just starting out, we’ve partnered with some great organisations to provide access to free online materials so suppliers can effectively fast-track their climate learning. Then we’ve given the next group up access to a platform that helps them calculate a footprint for the materials they sell to us, and we’ve commissioned independent consultants to help them develop the numbers. We’re funding the work, but the suppliers will own their data.
The third group of suppliers already know their product footprints, and so they’re testing a new data exchange mechanism intended to standardise the receipt of this data into our business. We need all our suppliers to share information in the same way – for example, without excluding methane emissions. Once this has been established, we’ll identify how we can best make use of the data for mutual benefit.
What has been the biggest learning so far?
I’ve been positively surprised that our pilot suppliers are much more advanced in their journey than we could see from desktop research. Having conversations rather than reading reports has been extremely informative.
We’re also learning to look at each business individually. If we’re buying skimmed milk powder from a host of different suppliers around the world, we know that the contexts are different. In some cases, it will be a smallholder farmer with three or four cows per farm. In other cases, it might be a couple of hundred cows with a high degree of automation and we know these factors influence the product footprint.
So absolute comparisons are risky because they don't show that level of context. It’s more important to know the trajectory of numbers. If they start at, for example, eight kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of skimmed milk powder, then we need to know how that figure is coming down over time. That’s the conversation we want to have.
What do you see as the biggest contribution Unilever can make?
I think we offer a deep insight into what drives consumption and consumer behaviour, combined with an understanding of the sources of emissions and climate impact of choices. This helps to build the business case for our suppliers and makes us a credible partner.
What do you think has been the biggest shift in Unilever’s climate strategy?
When I was recruited to join Unilever in South Africa, I asked, “OK, what kind of environmental strategy and programmes do you have as a business?” And they put a one-page environmental policy in front of me that was largely compliance-based. Since then, I’ve seen the evolution of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which brought sustainability to the forefront of the business, to our current Compass strategy, which integrates sustainability and business into one single strategy. It’s been a massive transformation and it’s fascinating and amazing to have been part of that.
Given the scale of the challenge that lies ahead, do you feel hopeful for the future?
I feel very motivated to work in this space, but I do it with a healthy dose of realism and pragmatism. I’m not blindly optimistic because I think we have to be realists to know what we’re dealing with so we can tackle it face on.
All the people I work with are absolutely committed to tackling this challenge – my colleagues in the Business Operations Sustainability team, our extremely smart R&D colleagues, our expert Science team and highly professional procurement organisation. And when you mobilise thousands of people in one direction, there’s massive potential to have an impact – both across our own business, and influencing other companies to follow.
text Through our beauty brand Lux, we’re voicing our support for South African athlete Caster Semenya who has been banned from defending her 800-metre gold medal at this year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo.
Caster has a genetic condition known as hyperandrogenism which means she produces a higher-than-average level of testosterone. Even though she was born this way, new legislation – introduced by World Athletics in 2018 – means she isn’t allowed to compete unless she takes hormone-suppressing drugs.
She has taken her case to the European Court of Human Rights to challenge this decision and Lux is lending its voice through its new ‘Born This Way’ campaign.
Centring on an emotive video, which features an animated Caster, the message of the campaign is clear: women should not be judged on how they look or be stripped of what makes them who they are.
“It pains me that women still constantly get judged for how they look and choose to express their femininity,” says Global VP of Lux Severine Vauleon. “Caster is an inspiration for women everywhere, to rise above the judgements of others and express their beauty fully and authentically. At Lux, we believe that beauty should be a source of strength rather than a source of judgement.”
“It makes me very happy to see brands like Lux who fearlessly stand on the side of what is right,” says Caster. “My case is but one among many experiences that are felt by women all over the world. This fight is not about me: it's about the future and those talented up-and-coming athletes who will face the same discrimination. I have to make sure that I can honestly say, I did my bit.”
Lux has set up a petition to help Caster overturn the World Athletics ruling and allow her to compete as a woman. To show your support, you can sign Lux’s petition and share your message online using the hashtag #IStandWithCaster.
A new era of beauty
The campaign is part of a broader global initiative in which the brand has pledged to inspire and help women rise above everyday sexist judgements and express their beauty and femininity unapologetically.
It’s also integral to Unilever’s Positive Beauty vision and strategy – launched in March – which aims to champion a new era of beauty that’s equitable and inclusive, as well as sustainable for the planet.

text The massive geographic variations in how the pandemic has hit different countries has been a defining feature of the Covid-19 crisis throughout the past 18 months, with waves of infections rising and falling at different times in different parts of the globe. It is certain that the vaccine roll-out, and our gradual unlocking back to normal life, will be equally uneven.
However, there is one constant: WHO and health experts universally agree that the pathway out of the pandemic will depend on vaccinations going hand in hand with maintaining effective hygiene habits as well as other preventative measures.
A plea from the frontlines
Lifebuoy’s new ‘It’s in Your Hands’ public health announcement echoes this sentiment. Reflecting the brand’s initial appeal, which featured in several countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East last year, the latest campaign emphasises the vital importance of maintaining hygiene precautions such as handwashing with soap (any soap not just Lifebuoy), social distancing and mask-wearing, as well as highlighting the importance of accepting vaccinations when offered.
“The arrival of vaccines is good news and a vitally important step towards getting our lives back to normal, but we can’t let our guard down yet, no matter how tired we are of following the rules to stay safe,” says Kartik Chandrasekhar, Global Brand Vice President of Lifebuoy. “As a brand, we’ve stepped up our efforts, especially in countries undergoing a vicious second wave. We recently issued our biggest global appeal yet which reminds everyone to adopt and practice the critical behaviours needed to get us through the pandemic.”
Launched in 20 countries and in over 30 languages, Lifebuoy’s latest public service announcement has already reached over 60% of all households1 across its largest markets, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan, with its powerful message. The appeal reflects the experience of doctors, nurses and social workers who are all on the frontline.
Amplifying the message
To ensure the message reaches as many people as possible, the brand has also enlisted the support of Unilever’s leadership across countries which have been badly affected by second waves including South Africa, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Joining them in supporting Lifebuoy’s appeal are more than 50 influencers and celebrities including Kajol Devgn, national award-winning actress and Lifebuoy ambassador, and popular sports icons such as Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh’s greatest cricketer, and Ravi Shastri, head coach of India’s National Cricket Team.
Remaining vigilant amid growing caution fatigue
It is hoped that this direct appeal will help counter the growing fatigue that has seen essential habits such as handwashing with soap and mask-wearing decline as the pandemic progresses.
A multi-country study undertaken by Lifebuoy at the end of 2020 indicated a gap between being hygiene aware and being hygiene compliant. It found 80% were aware of hand hygiene, but 30% still said they forgot to wash their hands.
The new health appeal aims to counter this trend by focusing on the impact non-compliance could have.
“Our experience of influencing positive hygiene behaviour goes beyond providing soap and hand hygiene,” says Kartik. “Having recently been recognised in Kantar’s 2021 Brand Footprint report as the third most chosen FMCG brand globally, we have a real opportunity to change people’s behaviour for the good of themselves and their families, as well as the wider community. More than ever, the speed at which we unlock from the pandemic will depend on individual actions. It really is in all our hands.”

text For the past ten years, we have been investing in sustainable agriculture to support our suppliers in adopting good practices. We have achieved tremendous progress but to really stop soil decline, preserve water resources, protect biodiversity, increase climate resilience and improve livelihoods, we know we need to do more.
This is why today we are announcing our Regenerative Agriculture Principles, a new approach to farming that works in harmony with nature to ensure the long-term viability and resilience of land.
As Dave Ingram, Unilever’s Chief Procurement Officer, says: “The ingredients for most Unilever products come from nature, so the future of our business is inextricably linked to the preservation and regeneration of natural environments. Initiatives like this do more than just benefit the planet. To be considered successful, they should also benefit and improve the livelihoods of our farmers, their families and surrounding communities, creating a cycle of prosperity on our journey to make sustainable living commonplace.”
Regenerative agriculture: taking things to a whole new level
In 2010, we introduced our Sustainable Agriculture Code, which has been the North Star for our sustainable sourcing programme and an important guide to sustainable farming for hundreds of thousands of suppliers, smallholders and farmers.
Building on that as a foundation, we are now adding a new layer of practices that aim to work with nature to regenerate it. Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles outlines the five priority areas we believe are in most urgent need of action and where we can achieve the biggest impact.
Regenerating soils 
It takes between 100 and 400 years to generate just 1cm of fresh, healthy soil because soil is slow to renew and requires certain conditions to thrive. Active soil management is critical to increasing productivity and resilience, and lowering emissions. We’re going to help farmers regenerate soil by supporting methods including keeping living roots in the ground, applying tillage practices that minimise disturbance to the soil surface and preventing erosion through cover cropping.
Protecting water 
Some 80% of the planet’s freshwater is used to produce crops and rear livestock. But temperatures are increasing globally, rainfall is unreliable, there are frequent floods and the demands for water are often in conflict. So farmers must adapt by using the resource more efficiently, managing irrigation and drainage better, and minimising water pollution. We will help farmers protect waterways from erosion and runoff, and select the most efficient irrigation technology and strategies.
Increasing biodiversity 
Natural ecosystems – which we need to support climate stability, water supplies, soil structure, and pest and disease control – have declined by an average of 47% in the last decade and continue to degrade at an unprecedented rate. Farmers are uniquely placed to help slow this decline, so we will support their efforts in various ways. These include creating conditions that increase plant and animal numbers, and habitats for insects that control pests.
Developing climate solutions 
As deforestation contributes to around 15% of global warming and farming is responsible for 24% of all greenhouse gases, addressing emissions from land use is critical. It’s estimated that 37% of the cost-effective emissions reductions the world needs by 2030 can come from natural climate solutions. We’ll keep carbon on the ground through avoiding conversion and by planting trees for different purposes such as timber, shade and animal feed.
Improving farmer livelihoods 
The world’s 500 million smallholder farmers face many challenges including limited training and lack of access to capital and technology. This leaves them vulnerable to poverty, hunger and the impacts of climate change. We will help improve their livelihoods through providing access to skills training, finance and markets, as well as supporting income diversification and women’s economic empowerment.
Putting the theory into action
To achieve the scale and pace of change we need to see, we will work with farmers, suppliers and partners on programmes across different geographies. We’ll prioritise our key crops – which include dairy, vegetables, grains, palm oil, soy, paper and board, coconut, cocoa and tea – because of their impact on land and their contribution to our greenhouse gas or human footprint. Here are just a few examples of programmes already underway.
Healthier soil
Knorr is partnering with tomato supplier Agraz in Spain to help improve soil health with the use of cover crops and organic fertiliser and increase biodiversity in the landscape through the planting of native flora.
We’re also introducing more efficient irrigation in Agraz’s tomato fields.
In hot climates, irrigation is essential to ensure crops stay healthy and hydrated. But establishing how much water to use has always been difficult. Cutting-edge sensors and soil probes now let farmers know the exact amount of water necessary for the fruit to flourish. This enables the supplier to manage water use and make significant savings.
Less water and fewer emissions
Building on existing sustainable sourcing programmes, Knorr is working with US rice supplier Riviana to implement a suite of farming practices that enable farmers to grow rice while preserving water and decreasing methane emissions.
The water-saving practices we’re advancing reduce the time the soil is flooded which in turn reduces emissions.
The brand is partnering with the University of Arkansas to engage the farmers in the programme, and to create and measure impacts of regenerative practices on emissions and water capture.
Improving livelihoods
Smallholder farmers manage around 40% of Indonesia's oil palm planted area, and as such our ability to empower them with regenerative agriculture practices is critical to delivering positive environmental outcomes and building supply chain resilience.
In Indonesia’s Riau province, we trained 1,800 independent smallholder farmers, together with our supplier PT Skip on good agricultural and regenerative practices, as well as no deforestation and better market access.
As a result of the project, the farmers have set up an association called Karya Serumpun, to continue activities within their community.
These outcomes will positively impact 10,000 hectares of land and improve the livelihoods of those involved in the project.
From ‘do less harm’ to ‘do more good’
We will continue to advocate for and lead the transformation of global supply chains towards more sustainable and regenerative models. This requires businesses like ours to work with governments and civil society to achieve sustainable development and make sustainable living commonplace.
As Hanneke Faber, President of our Foods & Refreshment division, says: “It is not enough for us to do less harm. We’re now seeking out opportunities to do more good. With our scale and influence, we have a crucial role to play in leading the systemic change our planet is crying out for.”

text Diesel engines have long been the default solution to power the cooling systems in refrigerated trucks. While the emissions from the trucks themselves are regulated and have shown improvement over the past few decades, transport refrigeration is currently unregulated and therefore dirtier.
The good news is we've started a nine-month pilot in the Netherlands to test a breakthrough innovation in temperature-controlled transport, replacing the diesel refrigeration in four trailers with zero-emission battery-electric prototypes.
The system - which keeps freight chilled at temperatures down to -25°C - will be tested to run entirely on renewable electricity. If successful, the technology could help us lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our 'cold chain': the transportation and refrigeration of our products.
If successful, it could save up to 25 tonnes of CO2 per trailer annually, with air quality benefits for each vehicle equivalent to taking 70 passenger cars off the road for a year.
Our partners in the pilot are equipment service provider TIP Trailer Services, green tech experts Maxwell and Spark, and transport company Daily Logistics Group (DLG).
"With logistics and distribution accounting for around 15% of our emissions, we are moving our cold chain to cleaner sources of energy," explains Michelle Grose, our Head of Logistics and Fulfilment. "We are partnering with innovators to pioneer new technology and find new solutions. This journey of co-creation will provide us with valuable learnings and insights to help us lower emissions from our vehicle fleet."

Part of our goal to achieving net zero by 2039
This latest trial is one of several measures we’re exploring to reduce emissions in our logistics network as we work towards our goals of halving the emissions footprint of our products by 2030 and net zero across our value chain by 2039.
Logistics and distribution covers transport from suppliers to factories, factories to distribution centres (DCs) and DCs to customers.
We achieved our 2020 target of 40% improvement in CO2 efficiency of our global logistics network (against a 2010 baseline) one year ahead of schedule. This was primarily driven by reducing distance travelled and improving truck utilisation, reducing the total number of trucks used.
While there is more opportunity in this space, we now need to accelerate the transition to zero-emissions transport solutions, shifting our focus to ‘greening’ the kilometres we still need to drive.
This is something we’ll be addressing in several ways including the additional use of railways to reduce demand for long-distance trucking and direct-to-consumer despatch from our factories to shorten the distance our products need to travel.
We’re also exploring hydrogen fuel cell and battery electric vehicles, as well as lower carbon transition fuels such as bio-liquified natural gas and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) fuel which are made from renewable, sustainable raw materials.
“The transport industry will be going through rapid change in the next decade as businesses gear up towards net zero ambitions,” says Mark Rickhoff, Head of Logistics for Unilever Benelux. “This means building new relationships with new types of partners, including equipment providers, OEMs and governments, to advance cleaner transport solutions. There is no silver bullet to achieve zero emissions, the industry needs to work to get there together along many different pathways.”
In line with our Carbon Zero Logistics Strategy, we are continuously striving for further emission reduction across all our operations as we work towards net zero by 2039. There are no easy answers for lowering emissions in the cold chain, but we are determined to take forward steps.
“Over the past few years, we evaluated and tested various solutions but realised that what we required was not on the market,” adds Mark. “That's why we partnered with others to develop the technology and the set-up we need. I'm proud that Unilever is rising to the challenge and excited to see where this trial takes us in the future.”

Today we launch a wide-ranging set of commitments and actions to raise living standards across our value chain, create opportunities through inclusivity and prepare people for the future of work.
From supporting people through Covid-19 to making more planet-friendly food, there’s been a lot going on this year at Unilever, for our business and for the communities we serve.
text One third of all food produced in this world is lost or wasted. This amounts to the gigantic quantity of 1.3 billion tonnes while more than 800 million people go hungry every day.
Not everybody realises yet that food loss and waste is not only a humanitarian and economic crisis, it’s a huge environmental issue.
Food waste feeds climate change. Around 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions originate from food waste. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China.
Moreover, food waste consumes large quantities of precious natural resources – like agricultural land as large as China and freshwater three times the size of Lake Geneva.
In the face of such big numbers, it may be hard to imagine what we can do as individuals to make a positive impact on this issue.
Today, on International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, we want to share the stories of six food waste warriors who work across our business. Through their ideas, skills and passion for action they are helping us cut food waste from farm to fork. We hope sharing their stories inspires you to make a difference too.
text Working alongside two partners – carbon recycling company LanzaTech and India Glycols, a manufacturer of green technology-based chemicals – we have produced a surfactant made from carbon emissions.
Surfactants are a key ingredient for creating the foam and cleaning action of many household cleaning and laundry products. They are typically derived from fossil fuels, but this new process means we can now make them using recycled carbon.
There are three stages to the process. LanzaTech first captures the industrial emissions at a steel mill in Beijing and converts the waste gases into ethanol. India Glycols then converts the ethanol into ethylene oxide, which is used to make a range of ingredients, including surfactants. We then use this surfactant in the manufacture of our new OMO (Persil) laundry capsules at our Hefei factory in China.
The process LanzaTech is using to create ethanol from captured carbon cuts the greenhouse gas emissions by 82% compared to the traditional fossil-fuel process.
The new limited-edition OMO capsules launched in China on 22 April – at no extra cost to consumers – marking the first time that a surfactant made using captured carbon emissions has come onto the market in a cleaning product.
“Advancements in technology like this means we can now reinvent the chemistry of our products,” says Peter ter Kulve, President of our Home Care division. “Instead of valuable carbon being released directly into the atmosphere, we can capture it and recycle it in our products in place of using fossil fuels.
“We want to make sustainability easy for everyone that uses our products. New innovations like this help move our iconic cleaning brands away from fossil fuels without compromising on performance or affordability. We’re excited by the potential that this breakthrough represents for future innovations across our portfolio and our industry.”
We’re excited by the potential that this breakthrough represents for future innovations across our portfolio and our industry. Peter ter Kulve, President, Unilever’s Home Care division 
Turning off the tap for fossil carbon
The launch of the new OMO capsules hit the shelves just as independent researchers Nova Institute publishes a first-of-its-kind report examining an overlooked aspect of climate change: embedded carbon.
The report calculates that 450 million tonnes of carbon are used each year to create organic chemicals and derived materials that go into everyday products from detergents to clothes, car tyres to mobile phones. If these products aren’t recycled or renewed at their end-of-life stage, most of this embedded carbon will end up in the atmosphere as CO2.
As the world focuses on decarbonising energy and mobility, this hidden problem is yet to be tackled. With demand for these products on the rise, the report highlights a radical transformation of this sector is needed with renewable carbon production to be increased by a factor of 15 by 2050.
As well as demonstrating the extent of the challenge, the report outlines two ambitious scenarios for 2050 that includes the total phase-out of additional fossil carbon resources. It also identifies three primary sources of alternative renewable carbon sources: recycling, biomass and CO2 capture.

The Carbon Rainbow
Our partnership with LanzaTech and India Glycols is part of our Clean Future strategy which, at its heart, has the ambition to replace 100% of the carbon derived from fossil fuels in our cleaning and laundry product formulations with renewable or recycled carbon by 2030.
Central to Clean Future is the ‘Carbon Rainbow’, a novel approach to diversify the carbon we use. Non-renewable fossil sources of carbon (identified in the Carbon Rainbow as black carbon) will be replaced using captured CO2 (purple carbon), plants and biological sources (green carbon), marine sources such as algae (blue carbon), and carbon recovered from waste materials (grey carbon).
text In a first, Unilever Pakistan released a video commemorating Pakistan’s 74th Anniversary featuring its own people singing the national anthem. Heartwarming and sincere, it celebrates the spirit of diversity and inclusion as the everyday heroes of Unilever Pakistan, our Receptionist, Tea Boys, Brand Ambassadors and Support staff take center stage as they go about their day expressing their love for the country.
The video is an ode to the country which has given us our unique identity and innumerable opportunities to be a force for good. It depicts our mission of #UnileverForPakistan as we see the many lives impacted by Unilever Pakistan and the livelihoods enhanced through our efforts, whether it is our Brand Ambassadors, our factory workers, distributions and trike peddlers. The video shows how beautifully all the parts fit together to make a sum total and how respect, dignity and pride in our work reflects in all our actions always.
We hope it inspires people to take pride in our country, our anthem and our resources and work on bettering livelihoods and acting sustainably every day.

text 135 years. That’s how long it will take for women to achieve gender parity (WEF, 2021). According to the World Economic Forum’s latest gender gap report, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused another generation of women to wait 36 years longer for equality, delaying their chances to participate in politics, access education and contribute to the economy. This has to change. Fast.
With full gender equality in the world of work, the global economy could grow by US$28 trillion by 2025 (BofA Global Research, 2021). So we’re taking a stand against discrimination and stereotypes, and championing equity within our business and in wider society. Because equal opportunities, equal respect and equal empowerment add up to a far more equal world.
A strategy built on equity
In 2020, we announced the Unilever Compass – our global corporate strategy, which sets out how we will grow our purpose-led business while delivering on our overarching goal of making sustainable living commonplace.
The Compass represents a natural evolution of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, through which we made some encouraging progress on gender equality in recent years. In 2019, for example, we achieved gender balance in our workforce at managerial level. And our work to promote safety, provide upskilling and expand opportunities had reached more than 2.6 million women by 2020.
Now we’re using the lessons we have learnt and the partnerships we have forged in the past decade to do more. From social inclusion and human rights to climate change and packaging waste, gender equity intersects every challenge we’re seeking to address.
A framework for fairness
As part of the Compass, we will unlock barriers and positively impact millions of women and girls. We are introducing a new Gender Equity Framework which will help us systematically address the needs of women across our value chain. Whether it’s on climate, health, or the future of work, we will look at how we can optimally empower women and drive gender equity.
Created in partnership with the International Center for Research on Women and in consultation with civil society, the Gender Equality Framework will help our teams and stakeholders implement measures to improve opportunities and remove barriers for women all over the world. Measures such as inclusive access to resources, and steps to ensure agency and safety for women across every part of our value chain.
We’re also committing to work with our suppliers within the next two years to promote the same approach. And we’re using our voice to encourage other companies and organisations to apply a gender equity lens to their work too.
Our footprint and focus
In order to create the necessary systemic change, we are focusing on the areas where we have the greatest influence: our workplace, our value chain, our brands and in society.
Within our workplace, we are stretching our gender-balance target to focus on our senior management levels, where we are implementing specific programmes to help accelerate women’s careers. In addition, we are investing in reskilling and upskilling all women in our organisation to create a more resilient future workforce.
Safety is a key enabler of women’s empowerment. Violence against women and girls has increased by 20% since Covid-19 hit, leading to UN Women calling it a ‘shadow pandemic’. We recognise the hidden nature of domestic violence and, in a business-first, on International Women’s Day this year we publicly shared our policy on global domestic violence and abuse to create more awareness and help inspire other employers to create their own.
Our responsibility stretches beyond our own operations and we are committed to ensuring the safety of the millions of women in our value chain. As an example, with IDH – the Sustainable Trade Initiative – and Tesco, we are investing €2 million in a new Women’s Safety Accelerator Fund to create a safe and empowering workplace. Based on UN Women’s Global Women’s Safety Framework in Rural Spaces, this fund will reach at least 200,000 women tea workers in Assam, India by 2023.
In our supply chain, this year we pledged to increase our annual expenditure with diverse suppliers to at least €2 billion by 2025 as part of a set of wide-ranging commitments to help build a more equitable and inclusive society. We will support women and other under-represented groups to get access to critical resources, such as finance, networking opportunities and skills. And we will drive up wages for everyone, working with our direct suppliers by mandating payment of a living wage.
Partnerships for progress
With our brands, we are able to reach millions of people all over the world every day. But we understand that if we want to make a truly global impact, we can’t do it alone. Partnerships are vital.
Our Dove brand is working closely with UNICEF to expand a long-standing partnership which aims to improve self-esteem and body confidence among young women all over the world.
Sunsilk has worked with NGO Girl Rising to create the educational programme Explore More Possibilities, which aims to empower girls to pursue their interests and passions so they can aspire to a limitless future. And there are many more examples. Equity and inclusion are key principles of the new Positive Beauty strategy we launched across our entire Beauty & Personal Care division this year too.
What we see on social media and on TV plays a significant role in shaping perceptions on gender. Through the Unstereotype Alliance, we are working with more than 180 global organisations to tackle harmful gender-based stereotypes in media and advertising content. Our Act 2 Unstereotype initiative is going further by unstereotyping all marketing activities to influence the next generation to be free from prejudice.
Finally, aligning with global standards is necessary to achieve a common understanding of gender equity. All Unilever’s work is designed to help deliver on relevant Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations, particularly SDG 5, and we are a proud signatory of the UN’s Women’s Empowerment Principles.
We also participate in the Generation Equality Forum, the biggest movement for women and girls in the next five years, bringing together governments, sustainability leaders and the private sector.
A way forward, together
“Action on gender equity is needed urgently, and companies have a key role to play in driving impact at scale,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope.
“It’s the right thing to do, but it makes business sense too. Companies cannot thrive and grow in failing societies.”
We have a vision of an equal world in which every woman and girl can break the chains caused by stereotypes, patriarchal limits and inequitable access to opportunities allowing them to feel empowered and to thrive. Because if half the world’s population is being held back, how can we all move forward together? The numbers simply don’t add up.

text This week saw leaders from business, government and the climate community, in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly and the City of New York, come together to drive climate action. Fast.
Because the numbers are clear. Climate change is costing the earth.
This year, Pakistan experienced flash floods that saw lives lost and millions of homes ruined while Europe faced its worst drought in 500 years. Natural disasters like these, exacerbated by climate change, cost the world $210 billion in 2020, a financial outlay that not only impacts communities but also the economies, businesses and infrastructure that serve them.
Climate risk impacts financial risk
Mitigating risks like these is one of the most cited financial reasons for investing in climate action. Money spent on equipment, emergency logistics, damaged products and lost sales is clearly visible on corporate balance sheets.
But the business case for investing in sustainability should not just focus on risk but also opportunity.
“Increasingly, companies are changing their business models to embed sustainability in their corporate strategy,” says Chief Supply Chain and Business Operations Officer, Reginaldo Ecclissato. But while 86% of organisations have a sustainability strategy in place, only 35% have acted on that strategy.
Unilever is one of them.
And we’re making sure that commitment is loud and clear to our consumers and the investment community.
The business case for decarbonising our business
We believe in a business model that can serve shareholders and stakeholders simultaneously. That can be a growth engine providing economic opportunity and climate justice. As a global company, it is impossible for us to do our fiduciary duty without considering climate change, destruction of nature and social inequality.
In 2021, we unveiled our Climate Transition Action Plan setting ourselves the goal of reducing our greenhouse emissions to zero by 2030, and those across our value chain to net zero by 2039.
“We were the first company in the world to put our decarbonisation plan to a shareholder vote,” CEO Alan Jope told a business audience in New York. It was supported by 99.6% of our investors.
“Stating that we have a climate emergency is becoming an unpopular thing to do,” Jope adds. “We will not back down on this agenda.”
Across our operations, we’re working with suppliers at local and state level to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Our Future Foods commitments are working to transform global food systems and reduce the impact of waste. Home Care’s Clean Future initiatives are replacing 100% of black carbon from fossil fuels with a carbon rainbow of renewable or recycled alternatives, while our Beauty and Personal Care brands are helping improve health and wellbeing through Positive Beauty.
As well as decarbonising our product portfolio, we’re investing €1 billion in our Climate &Nature Fund to help combat climate change over the next ten years and we’ve lent our support to the COP26 call for $100 billion/yearto support developing countries to take action on climate issues.
While all these investments are driven by a business looking to do good, they are also initiatives that are good for our business.
Attracting consumers through brands that commit to climate
In an IBM survey of 16,000 consumers in ten major economies, 51% said that environmental stability is more important to them than it was a year ago, and 49% paid a premium for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible.
“By sourcing sustainable ingredients and using recycled and recyclable packaging, we’re making it easy for consumers to choose the brands they already trust, knowing that they don’t cause harm,” says Chet Henderson, VP, Consumer Insights team.
And that strategy is bringing results.
Today, our 13 billion dollar brands shaped by sustainability and purpose account for more than 50% of our group turnover. In the first half of this year, they also delivered 9.4% underlying growth.
Winning the war on talent
And it’s not just consumers who seek out sustainability from companies. One in three people who changed jobs last year accepted a role with an employer they consider to be environmentally sustainable, and 34% took a role where they could directly influence environmentally sustainable outcomes.
As the graduate employer of choice in more than 50 companies, we recognise our climate credentials are a key part of winning the war on talent. And with BCG research showing that companies who attract high-calibre candidates achieve 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.1 times the average profit margin, we look forward to seeing how these future leaders can impact our bottom line.
Investment will determine the quality of our future lives
But while we can share our story and commitment to climate investment – it’s one story. The world needs more businesses to act sustainably and more investors to back them, and wider multilateral goals to succeed in keeping temperatures below -1.5°C.
“There’s a $3 trillion spread between what we’re doing and what needs to happen,” Tom Steyer, co-founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, told investors and financiers at Climate Week.
That means investors and financiers need to “invest and underwrite with intent,” says Jason Storah, CEO of Aviva Canada, a member of the UN Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, and that capital is mobilised to find low carbon solutions.
Investment communities are taking note.
Larry Fink’s investment company Blackrock has the ear of Wall Street and beyond thanks to the $10 trillion it manages. In his annual letter to CEOs, he was clear: “Stakeholder capitalism is not woke, it is capitalism.”
And momentum is gathering. Fiona Reynolds is CEO of Principles for Responsible Investment, a Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance created between her company and the UN’s Environment Programme Finance Initiative.
It can cite members from 50 of the world's largest asset owners that have more than $7 trillion in assets under management.
That weight of capital is now being directed towards making a climate difference, with the Alliance committing to transitioning their investment portfolios by 2050. They have also set targets for 2025.
Governments are beginning to act too, with New Zealand one of the few countries to have enshrined its 2050 net zero emissions target in law. It has allocated NZ$4.5 billion to a Climate Emergency Response Fund in its 2022 budget, alongside its pre-budget commitment of NZ$2.9 billion to the Emissions Reduction Plan.
So the direction of travel is clear.
But more of the investment community need to mobilise their funds for climate. As Reynolds says, “investing as usual isn’t going to cut it.”
We no longer have the luxury of time. “Established systems have their own inertia, and even if a better future is possible,” says Thomas Lingard, Unilever’s Global Climate and Environment Director, “it won’t happen unless enough people and organisations stand up to show how it can be done, to advocate both for the business action that is necessary, and the changes to the policy frameworks that would enable it.”
Choices need to be made to rebuild the world in a healthy way. If investors and financiers pull together with governments, NGOs and sustainable business, we can get things done.

text Globally, a third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted and 900 million tonnes is thrown away every year, with more than 60% of this waste occurring in the home.
No one ever sets out with the intention of throwing good food in the bin, but life gets in the way. Plans change. Food that was meant to be eaten on Saturday is still sitting there on Thursday. And many people don’t have the skills or confidence to turn seemingly unrelated ingredients left in their fridge into a tasty meal.
But, as Hellmann’s has found out, tackling this problem doesn’t require people to make big changes to long-held habits in terms of how they buy, store and cook food. It can be done with small, simple steps that involve very little time, skill and effort.
A delicious meal is as easy as 3+1
Through one of the longest and largest behavioural studies into household food waste, Hellmann’s discovered that adopting just one ‘Use-Up Day’ per week – making a meal using ingredients already in the fridge and kitchen – can reduce the amount of food thrown away by a third.
The study found that the main reasons people throw away food at home include forgetting what’s in the fridge, freezer or cupboard, or not knowing what to make with left-behind ingredients. So these items are often ignored and eventually binned.
Through some easy-to-use tools, Hellmann’s created a way to help people see the potential to make a delicious meal from what they have to hand, giving them confidence in their skills and resourcefulness.
The brand developed the ‘3+1 Approach’ to give people a simple rule of thumb: use a base (such as bread, rice or pasta), vegetable or fruit, and a protein of choice (like tofu or eggs). Then bring these ingredients together with a ‘magic touch’ such as herbs, spices or a condiment to add flavour.
The concept was accompanied by a book of ‘Flexipes’ – flexible recipes – which applied the 3+1 Approach with ideas for using up commonly wasted ingredients like bread, tomatoes, apples and potatoes.
As Global Brand VP Christina Bauer-Plank says: “This study took people from a mindset of ‘what do I want to cook and what ingredients do I need’ and reframed it as ‘what food do I already have and what can I make with it’. By giving them the tools and motivation to be more resourceful, we have shown them how to reduce the amount of food they throw away each week.”
Kelly Peters, co-founder of behavioural scientists BEworks – Hellmann’s research partner for the study – backs this up: “Reducing food waste does not require complex physical interventions like specially organised fridges or the adoption of new, time-consuming habits. We designed solutions based on the fundamentals of the human experience and the science of behaviour change.”
There’s evidence that good habits will continue
Use-Up Days helped participants in the study make the food they had on hand more salient, reminding them to look for possibilities to use them before they go off. And for the majority, it wasn’t a chore. In fact, about three-quarters said they actually found it easy by following the 3+1 Approach and Flexipes.
Taking part in the study also improved people’s creativity in the kitchen. In a follow-up survey, seven out of ten said they felt more resourceful and six out of ten more confident. And most people – over 70% – said they had saved money on the household food budget.
Interestingly, the mere act of filling in a weekly survey – which each participant was asked to do as part of the study – meant that they were more conscious of the food they wasted and, as a result, it reduced.
Importantly, it was encouraging to see that the good habits people developed as part of the study continued. Eight weeks after it finished, eight out of ten participants were still creating a use-up meal and seven out of ten felt more inspired to use up ingredients they already had.
First Canada, next the world
Hellmann’s and BEworks conducted the study with more than 1,000 families in Canada, which is one of the worst offending countries globally for food waste, with almost two-thirds of the food thrown away still edible.
The study demonstrated that participants reduced their food waste by a third. If all Canadian family households adopted this programme, the total amount saved would be in the region of 250,000 tonnes per year.
Following the success of this initial study, Hellmann’s is building the programme into a scalable, digital experience for further testing with the intention of making it available across Canada from the autumn. The ultimate aim is to roll it out globally.
“As Hellmann’s reaches into millions of homes every day through our products,” says Christina, “we have an opportunity and a responsibility to help people become more resourceful with their food to ultimately help waste less food.”
text How did that happen? Somehow, a six-pack of yummy Mini Magnums and other items you hadn’t planned for have made their way into your weekly online shop or food delivery order.
According to author of “The Buying Impulse”, D.W. Rook, the items are there thanks to a sudden, powerful, and persistent urge to buy something immediately.
And you’re not alone. Research by Invesp reveals the average shopper will impulse buy at least three items in 40% of their shopping trips. In the US, shoppers spend an average of $81.75 (€78.18) per session on impulse purchases, British consumers spend $267.14 (€255.53) per month.
That emotional trigger is also a marketing opportunity. To ensure consumers choose your brand when spontaneity strikes is all about knowing your audience, their trigger points and having the right infrastructure in place to deliver. Something that the teams who drive ICNOW – our Ice Cream Now division – are incredibly good at.
ICNOW was born from a crazy idea to place a cabinet in a delivery partner’s HQ to test if consumers would be interested in ordering ice cream online in the same way they order pizza and burgers.
Fast forward four years and ICNOW deliver smiles in more than 40+ countries and grew 60% in 2021 by ensuring consumers can have ice cream through three routes to purchase: Ice Cream with a Meal, Ice Cream with Groceries, and dedicated Ice Cream Virtual Stores that they can access via delivery apps.
Here are just five of the different ways ICNOW is fulfilling the needs of new consumers and delivering growth.
Making the wait for a food order way more appetising
Grab is South East Asia’s leading super app offering consumers food and grocery deliveries, taxi, car and bike rides, financial services and more.
During the pandemic, demand for sweet treats, especially ice cream, rose in the region. However, movement restrictions meant that consumers couldn’t easily access ice cream products from home.
The ICNOW teams worked with Grab to turn neighbourhood ‘mom-and-pop' grocery stores into Ice Cream Virtual Stores so consumers could purchase Wall’s ice creams via the app and have them delivered in minutes.
To increase awareness, consumers on Grab were shown ads for Wall’s ice cream at various steps of their purchasing journey, including native image ads on users’ home pages, and power banners while their order was in-transit.
When the consumer clicked on the ad for one of our ice creams, they were directed to the brand’s virtual store, before checking out and redeeming an exclusive deal or discount in a few simple clicks. This ability to go from awareness to conversion quickly brought results.
In Thailand, the ad campaign, which ran for a year, generated millions of impressions, with a high click-through rate and above two times return on ad spend (ROAS).
In the Philippines, our Selecta Happiness campaign delivered over nine times ad spend (ROAS) and exceeded the campaign sales target by around 1.5 times. To increase sales, we drove the campaign across in-app placement by having the native image, masthead, food banners and in-transit ads. Outside of the app, delivery drivers used visuals from the Grab app on their vehicles to increase awareness of the campaign.
Trialling media placement to tantalise users’ tastebuds 
In Singapore, the ICNOW team was the first partner to work with Food Panda (part of Delivery Hero globally) to use its third-party Media Placement Advertising Portal called Citrus Ads. The team trialled two ad placements for six weeks which included the use of specific search terms such as brownie ice cream and sub-category search.
For ad placements, we saw our media spend becoming three times more effective. Top performing products Magnum Mini Almond and Ben & Jerry Chocolate Fudge Brownie saw a ROAS of five times and three times, respectively. And ROAS at least doubled for keywords such as Magnum, ice cream pint, brownie ice cream and ice cream.
Hailing an ice cream store to come to you
In the US, ICNOW is working with Robomart to offer consumers the chance to hail a virtual ice cream store as easily as an Uber. “You tap a button to hail the store to come to you,” Ali Ahmed, Robomart CEO and co-founder, told Forbes magazine. Once it arrives, the consumer swipes across the app to open the Robomart vehicle’s door and handpick selected products.
They don’t have to spend time creating a basket or hunting for a specific item, and purchases are check-out free as the company uses radio frequency identification (RFID) to track products consumers remove from the van. “You literally just grab the products you want and walk away,” Ahmed says. Active users of Robomart, on average, hail a Robomart to their location 2.3 times a week, with the company recording 9% user growth and 10% order growth per week.
“We’re thrilled to partner with Robomart to offer a new way to bring our virtual store, The Ice Cream Shop, to fans in Los Angeles in an innovative way,” adds Russel Lilly, General Manager, Unilever North American Ice Cream. “Our pilot programme with Robomart is revolutionising ice cream delivery for consumers and making it even faster to get our beloved brands to our ice cream fans. What better way to shop for your favourite ice cream than just a few steps from your front door?”
Quenching real and virtual appetites in the metaverse
In June this year, Magnum unveiled the first Pleasure Museum at Europe’s biggest metaverse festival, MET AMS in Amsterdam. Visitors were transported to the virtual gallery in Decentraland, where they had the chance to enjoy original artworks from previous Magnum art collaborations. Better still, they were offered the chance to order one of Magnum’s latest ice creams from a vending machine in the metaverse which, thanks to Deliveroo, was delivered to them to enjoy in real life.
Matteo Trichilo, Head of Growth Ice Cream Now, has already worked with gaming platforms to offer players the chance to purchase in-game and have ice creams delivered on demand. For him, the gallery “was a great way to trial it in a new, emerging space and to test the consumer journey of the future.”
“Thanks to our partners at MET AMS and Deliveroo, we have been able to simulate the ordering process of Magnum ice cream from the metaverse to real life. What’s more, Magnum became the bestselling brand on our virtual ice cream store on Deliveroo in the Netherlands during the event. We are really looking forward to developing this platform in the future.”
“The metaverse is a hugely exciting prospect for us,” adds Federico Russo, Global Magnum Ecommerce lead at Unilever. “McKinsey research estimates eCommerce in the metaverse could reach $2–2.6 trillion by 2030.”
And consumer appetite is there. In a recent poll of 5,700 US and European consumers by ProductsUp, 40% of shoppers said they were “excited” to buy virtual products that will “enhance their experience”. Key drivers for purchases were experiencing life-like features (46%), a faster return processes (45%), and the ability to place an order in the metaverse for a physical product that is delivered in the real world (44%). “We worked hard to ensure our first step into the metaverse helped showcase how Magnum could deliver through experiencing exciting artists in our very own virtual museum and ordering during it and ending with by enjoying a Magnum ice cream in real life,” he says.
Sending Twisters into space and back without melting
In Turkey, Twister is the third-biggest ice cream brand after Magnum and Cornetto. Turnover-wise, it’s the biggest brand in the kids’ ice cream category, and unit leader within total ice cream aiming for 120 million sticks this year. To launch a new variant called Cosmix, the brand team decided to create an activation that was literally out of this world. Twister was launched into orbit and came back to earth without melting.
“We started with creating excitement with the consumers by airing our ad, then an unmissable activation to engage and amaze the consumers that literally took our product to the edge of the atmosphere, which was followed by activities to own a place in consumer’s hearts,” explains Algida Turkey Snacking & Kids Brand Manager and Digital Champion for Ice Cream, Hazal Kantman. 
It’s early days results-wise, but more than 10,000 people have engaged in the messaging and on the day of the activation, Twister recorded the highest-ever sales we made in the biggest national account in Turkey.
text Back in 1894, Unilever helped to improve hygiene with Lifebuoy soap during the cholera epidemic that was sweeping across Victorian England. 126 years later, thanks to the Hygiene and Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC) created by Unilever and the UK government, Lifebuoy and Domestos, alongside other Unilever hygiene brands, have helped to reach a billion people through HBCC hygiene behaviour programmes.
“Our business has a century-long history of promoting hygiene through our brands, but this unprecedented crisis called for an unprecedented response,” says Rebecca Marmot, Chief Sustainability Officer, Unilever.
Handwashing and hygiene: fundamental measures recommended by public health authorities
Handwashing and hygiene are two of the most effective, affordable and easiest ways to help reduce the spread of germs. It was with the aim of helping as many people as possible adopt good hygiene habits that the UK government’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and Unilever jointly launched the £100 million HBCC global effort in March 2020.
Since then, Unilever, with its expertise in hygiene behaviour change and mass media communications, has worked with 21 NGOs and UN partners via the HBCC to implement on-ground programmes and run mass media campaigns, aimed at raising hygiene awareness and teaching hygiene principles.
Unilever’s hygiene brands Domestos and Lifebuoy have a long history of hygiene programming. The HBCC projects have been established using these existing evidence-based programmes, benefiting from proven behaviour-change methodology.
Unilever also led the creation of a bespoke HBCC hygiene campaign: Hands–Face–Space–Surface. The campaign teaches and reminds people of the importance of key hygiene behaviours in the fight against Covid-19. It has been translated into more than 30 languages and will be aired in over 18 countries.
Through HBCC initiatives, over 500,000 handwashing stations have been installed around the world and over 140,000 community health workers and teachers have been trained to deliver information on the importance of correct hygiene practice. More than 75 million Unilever hygiene products, including Domestos bleach and Lifebuoy soap and hand sanitiser, have also been donated and distributed in over 60 countries.

The HBCC was designed to reach populations and communities whose living conditions increased their susceptibility to contracting Covid-19 and other infectious disease. NGO and UN partners were selected based on their experience and expertise in delivering programmes to vulnerable communities, such as refugees.
Working with partners such as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has allowed the HBCC to establish specialist programmes that can effectively support people living through some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, including in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. Over 30 million Unilever hygiene products have been donated to UNHCR for direct distribution to refugee communities.
The power of public–private collaboration
Of course, the huge scope and the quick deployment of the HBCC programme would not have been possible without the close collaboration of the public and private sectors. Unilever’s partnership with the FCDO, overseen by academic experts in behaviour change and WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), represents the UK’s largest public–private partnership established to help slow the spread of the virus in vulnerable countries.
“Public–private partnership has been critical, allowing us to leverage the influence, expertise and networks of both government and business, and our strong network of NGO and UN partners, at home and overseas. We’re pleased to work together with partners to implement initiatives to address the pandemic at scale,” says Rebecca Marmot, Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer.
Hygiene remains critical in months to come
Experts agree that hygiene, alongside free and universal vaccination programmes, will continue to be of fundamental importance in the long-term response to Covid-19. Continued focus on hygiene is especially important where vaccines are not yet available. For countries that are cautiously eyeing post-pandemic life, maintaining focus on hygiene will be vital in helping people continue to live happy, healthy lives.
We know that there are large inequalities in access to hygiene and sanitation. Four in ten people do not have access to soap and water in their homes. It is our hope that one silver lining from this crisis may be recognition at a much greater scale of the vital role hygiene plays in health.
text Buy once. Refill for life.* That’s the thinking behind Dove’s new refillable deodorant. It’s a first for the brand and a launch that’s set to disrupt the entire deodorants sector.
“Our refillable deodorant represents a new, more sustainable way of consumption – reinventing the daily deodorant for a planet in crisis,” explains Augusto Garzon, Dove’s Global Vice President of Deodorants.
“Thanks to this sleek, minimalist design, we’ve created something that’s more sustainable and more desirable
“A major step forward for the beauty industry”
As part of the project, Dove consulted with A Plastic Planet, an organisation which exists to “ignite and inspire the world to turn off the plastic tap”.
“Imagine a world where nothing hits the bin, where we can use the products we love without the guilt of creating yet more waste,” says the organisation’s co-founder Sian Sutherland.
“As one of the biggest beauty companies in the world, Dove recognising this, and leading the way to make refillable personal care products widely available to all, is a major step forward for the beauty industry.”
So how does it work?
The refillable deo comes in a durable, precision-engineered stainless steel case that’s designed to last a lifetime.* It’s so strong that it can withstand a force equivalent to being driven over by a car.** Keeping raw materials to a minimum, the Dove logo is engraved onto the metal, so there’s no plastic or paper wrapping or branding. And the case is sold in a box made from recyclable 100% Forest Stewardship Council-approved card.
Dove estimates the refillable deo will help reduce virgin plastic waste by around 30 tonnes in its first year, as the case is made of stainless steel and the refill packaging is made from 98% recycled plastic. The refill packaging still requires a small amount of plastic to keep the deodorant fresh and hygienic, but Dove has created a solution that uses 54% less plastic than its regular stick pack.
By 2023, the brand aims to have reduced virgin plastic waste by up to 160 tonnes and have the refills made from 100% recycled plastic.
Refills are available in three fragrances, and all use Dove’s most caring aluminium-free formula – the only aluminium and alcohol-free deodorant on the market that’s enriched with one-quarter moisturisers. As well as skin-softening glycerin, the sticks contain effective odour-blocking ingredients and deliver 48-hour odour protection. Each refill clicks into the stainless steel case without mess or waste.
An ongoing commitment
In line with Unilever’s global commitments to reduce our plastic consumption, Dove currently has more than 100 different projects running around the world to explore sustainable solutions to product packaging.
By 2025, the brand has pledged that all Dove packs will be either plastic-free, made from 100% recycled plastic, or able to be refilled or reused. And in the last ten years, Dove’s initiatives to reduce plastic have already avoided the use of more than 10,000 tonnes of virgin plastic through redesign and use of recycled materials.
“Dove’s refillable deodorant is one of our existing ongoing sustainability initiatives to fight plastic waste. In 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce the use of virgin plastic by more than 20,500 tonnes per year. Given Dove’s size as one of the largest beauty companies in the world, we have the opportunity – and responsibility – to make a significant impact,” adds Dove’s Executive Vice President Alessandro Manfredi.
Dove refill deodorants are on sale in the US, from Target, Walmart, Tar​get.com and Walmart.com.
* Lifetime guarantee applies to stainless steel case only (refills excluded). For more detail, see terms & conditions at www.dove.com/refill.
** Calculated based on the case’s ability to withstand top-load force of around 400kg (880lb) and 1,600kg average weight for a compact car. Four cases (one under each tyre) collectively can support a car weighing 1,600kg.

During March and April 2020, increasingly severe lockdown restrictions were imposed in Ukraine as the pandemic spread. The country faced the dual challenges of containing the virus and maintaining the economy. “When the pandemic started in Ukraine, we had lots of issues,” says Viktoria Voznyuk, Corporate Affairs Lead, who is based in Kiev. In March 2020, a national emergency was declared, with lockdown measures put in place. The company faced issues of importing, transport, on-shelf availability and more – yet the population still needed to live and eat. Hygiene products were more important than ever.
Getting our products onto the shelves
The route to market was effectively blocked as lockdown took hold. Swift action had to be taken at the interface of company and government, and Viktoria stepped up to the plate. Working with stakeholders in the industry and business associations, she negotiated with all the parties to exempt Unilever from the government restrictions. “I was particularly grateful to the European Business Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine for their support for our business 24/7 and for helping resolve the multiple issues,” she says.
Keeping the business operational took a lot of organisation. Public transport services were halted, for example, and Unilever had to bus employees to the factory. Viktoria and her team had to establish contact with government officials to gain permission for the dedicated buses to operate, and a weekly pass was secured. This and similar problems involved telephone calls, online meetings and regular catch-ups with the authorities.
Her efforts, and those of her colleagues, paid off. Unilever was added to the national list of ‘critical infrastructure’ companies which were allowed to continue their operations during lockdown, ensuring business continuity. So, from the start of lockdown, Unilever’s business processes were able to move forward with only temporary disruption.
The Covid crisis hit Ukraine at a time when healthcare reforms were about to take effect. These reforms were suspended but it was a moment when private sector involvement was especially welcome.
Viktoria approached the Ministry of Health with a proposal for product donations. “We provided around 50 hospitals in 24 regions in Ukraine with disinfectants as well as hygiene products,” she says.
After negotiating with the Ministry, Viktoria was able to make direct contact with local government leaders and regional state administrations in 24 areas to deliver the product donations directly to the core hospitals dealing with the infection.
Schools also benefited. Viktoria worked with Unilever’s local marketing team on a schools initiative. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education and UNICEF, Unilever made donations of Domestos and other products to ensure that school students could take their exams in safety. No sooner was the exam season over than the new school year began, so the donations continued, together with a hygiene awareness programme created for children. This extended product donation project reached 2,300 schools and 450,000 school students across the country.
And through a collaboration with UNHCR – the UN refugee agency – donations, which included soap, sanitisers and disinfectants, were also made to displaced and vulnerable groups. The donation programmes secured wide media coverage, which reached around 5 million Ukrainians.
Viktoria’s activities this past year accord with her own sense of purpose. “I want to make a really significant change for people, for society and for my country – especially for my country,” she says. “I am one of those lucky people who are doing the things that they really love to do.”
text Young people are highly compassionate. They care deeply about others and the planet, and they want to act on these concerns.
However, they also think, often mistakenly, that their peers and adults around them, do not share their feelings of care and compassion. As a result, they can feel isolated in their concerns and choose not to engage with the issues they care about for fear of not fitting in.
This is called the values-perception gap, and it can make young people feel anxious about the future, as well as having a negative impact on their wellbeing and potential.
These are some of the insights revealed by new research commissioned by the Persil Dirt Is Good Project, exploring the challenges facing parents and children at a time not only of ecological crisis but also of rising social division and inequality.
The Persil Dirt Is Good (DIG) Generation Action White Paper (PDF 18.06 MB) suggests that engaging young people in activities that promote collective compassion could be the key in helping them to take positive action on the issues they care about.
The challenge of childhood and parenting in a changing global landscape
The White Paper is based on two sets of research. In collaboration with Global Action Plan, an NGO that specialises in sustainable behaviour change, and in particular education for sustainable development, the brand conducted studies with children in the UK and Turkey aged 7–18.
The aim was to better understand what values were important to young people, how they perceived the values of others and how this affected their wellbeing and their willingness to get involved in the issues they cared about.
In parallel, the brand conducted research into the concerns parents had about the role their children could play in making a positive impact on their world and how they, as parents, could best equip them with the skills they needed to do so (Edelman Data and Intelligence).
Insights revealed:
Only 1 in 4 parents felt optimistic about the world their child is growing up in
Many parents were using ‘shielding’ techniques to protect their children from the realities of the global social and climate crisis
But young people were already aware and engaging in these realties
And they perceived the lack of engagement on these topics from adults/parents as a lack of concern, which impacted their wellbeing
Children as young as 11 believed that their concerns were not shared by friends and family, even though this was not in fact true
By the age of 14–16 the ‘values-perception gap’ led many to believe their peers held values that were more predominantly self-interested than was actually true.
Collective action grounded in compassion
Although the values-perception gap had been reflected in studies with adults, this is the first time it has been identified in children.
Living with this type of distorted perception of other people’s priorities can have a wide range of negative effects on children, including lower emotional wellbeing, increased worry about the future and a reluctance to act on causes they care about.
This is why DIG is launching a global programme of initiatives aimed at inspiring children and young people to take action on the issues that are important to them. The hope is that once they start taking action together, they will see that many others share their values and gain the confidence to continue to make positive change.
Listening to the future
To mark the launch of the White Paper, Persil convened a panel discussion to explore what support young people needed in order to drive the changes they wanted to see.
The importance of being heard was a predominant theme in the discussion. Josita, a 16-year-old from Sunderland, reflected on the fact that many young people often did not feel as if their opinion mattered.
“At times you feel like you are not being listened to, you aren’t being heard, especially with people that you respect like your teachers and your parents – the people you look to for inspiration and motivation,” she said.
Alison Kriel, Head Teacher, agreed, emphasising that this had to be at the heart of the Dirt is Good Project. “What is truly brilliant about projects like this is that we are saying children should have a voice. They do have the voice. Let’s celebrate what they have to say.”
Leading by example
The importance of having mentors that mirror the concerns of young people, whether they be teachers, parents or even organisations, was also emphasised.
Tati Lindenberg, Unilever’s Dirt Is Good Marketing VP, reflected: “The moment that young people see that the whole community, including big companies, are doing something, it creates momentum and galvanises others. It ensures that they don’t feel alone in their concerns. It leads to more positive action being taken and better wellbeing for young people. I strongly believe that businesses have the opportunity and the responsibility to demonstrate we care through our actions.”
Richard Gerver, speaker and author, agreed: “If we can do these three things, collaboration, communication and interconnecting generations across wider ranges of society and make sure our kids are at the heart of it, then we can help to catalyse profound change in the way young people see themselves and their role in the world.”
Celebrating the value of kindness and compassion
Achieving these goals will require a profound change of attitude, to protect the natural compassion and engagement that young people often lose as they mature.
“As they get older, [children] start to believe less and less in their own ability to make a difference,” says Richard. “To an extent, that’s because we assume children somehow need to earn the right to be smart, clever and to be activists. What we must do is flip the narrative so that we allow children to be excellent from a very young age.”
Cara Augustenborg, environmental scientist, agrees. “Children are born compassionate; it’s already instilled in them. It’s there naturally. As they go through the school system, they become less connected with each other and have a more negative outlook on each other and on the world around them. We need to step up. We need to start valuing the unmeasured curriculum.”
If projects like DIG can help young people bridge the values-perception gap that is holding them back, it could signal good news not only for the future of our society and planet, but also for the long-term wellbeing of our children.
As Dr Emma Seppala, Lecturer at Yale School of Management, stated, “Research shows that when you’re engaged in altruistic, compassionate acts, you don’t get a quick burst of dopamine that then disappears. It actually leads to fulfilment over a longer period of time.”
text Look at the picture above. Would you be surprised to discover that both images are of the same girl?
The make-up and hairstyling are obviously different. But there is more to it than that. Look carefully and you will see that the girl’s face on the right is fundamentally different. Her nose, her lips and her chin have all been digitally altered using a retouching app. The result? A picture that reflects a conventional image of beauty but that loses any sense of the real girl behind the selfie.
Fifteen years after the launch of the Evolution campaign addressing the issue of image manipulation in advertising, Dove is again focusing on the problems of image distortion with a powerful new film – ‘Reverse Selfie’ (see below), which highlights the damage social media pressure and retouching apps are causing to girls’ self-esteem.
Retouching apps: distorting self-esteem as well as selfies
According to recent research* carried out by Dove:
80% of girls said they had already applied a filter or used a retouching app to change the way they look in their photos by age 13
80% said they compared the way they looked with others on social media
77% tried to change or hide at least one body part/feature before posting a photo of themselves
Girls who distort their photos are more likely to have low body-esteem (48%) compared to those that don’t distort their photos at all (28%)
The pressure for perfection
“Now that social media has grown to be part of our everyday lives, digital distortion is happening more than ever and tools once only available to the professionals can be accessed by young girls at the touch of a button without regulation,” says Alessandro Manfredi, Executive Vice President of Dove, reacting to these results.
Dr Phillippa Diedrichs, Research Psychologist at the Centre of Appearance Research at the University of West England and body image expert, agrees. She highlights the double-edged sword these apps can be. “Powerful editing apps on smartphones have democratised the way in which girls can be creative with their photography. But these apps also cause huge damage to the confidence of young girls,” she says.
“Although certain aspects of social media can promote connection and wellbeing, in recent years dozens of scientific studies have shown that social media can negatively influence body confidence, mood and self-esteem,” she explains.
“This happens when users spend significant amounts of time posting selfies, using editing apps and filters to alter their appearance, comparing themselves to others, and seeking validation through comments and likes. It’s therefore imperative that we help young people to develop skills to navigate social media in a healthy and productive way.”
From selfies to self-confidence
Dove’s new campaign aims to tackle these issues by providing parents, carers and young people with a toolkit that can help them navigate social media in a more positive way.
With 34% of teenagers spending an average of three hours a day scrolling on their feeds, talking about healthy social media habits now feels as critical for their wellbeing as discussing sex or puberty.
Research-driven and academically validated, the Dove Confidence Kit offers a wide range of materials, including practical suggestions that girls can put in place, such as curating their feed to ensure what they see is appropriate and empowering. It also includes conversation starters that can help parents and girls evaluate the reality of what they see on social media.
“Girls all around the world have begun to feel the pressure to edit and distort how they look, to create something ‘perfect’, which cannot be achieved in real life,” reflects Alessandro. “After a year of increased screen-time, there’s never been a more important time to act.”
As the leading provider of self-esteem education worldwide, the Dove Self-Esteem Project has been on a mission to build self-esteem and positive body image in young people since 2004, with the ambition of reaching 250 million young people globally by 2030.

text Unilever has a long history of driving social change, from improving the health and wellbeing of more than 1 billion people to enhancing the livelihoods of millions under our Sustainable Living Plan.
We are proud of these achievements. But we’re also acutely aware that we need to do more, because the social challenges people now face have grown even more severe.
In 2019, for instance, more than 630 million workers worldwide – almost one in five of all those employed – did not earn enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.
That’s why we’re announcing a set of ambitious commitments and actions to help build a more equitable and inclusive society. These include:
“The two biggest threats that the world currently faces are climate change and social inequality,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “The past year has undoubtedly widened the social divide, and decisive and collective action is needed to build a society that helps to improve livelihoods, embraces diversity, nurtures talent and offers opportunities for everyone.”
Raising living standards
Ensuring that people earn a living wage is a critical step towards building a more equitable and inclusive society. It allows people to afford a decent standard of living, covering their basic needs such as food, housing and healthcare.
We already pay our employees at least a living wage. Now we want to secure the same for more people beyond our workforce, specifically focusing on the most vulnerable workers in manufacturing and agriculture. We’ll work with our suppliers, other businesses, governments and NGOs to create system-wide change and encourage the global adoption of living wage practices.
As Gabriela Bucher, Executive Director at Oxfam International, says: “Unilever’s plan shows the kind of responsible action needed from the private sector that can have a great impact on tackling inequality, and help build a world in which everyone has the power to thrive, not just survive.”
At the same time, we will help 5 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in our retail value chain access skills, finance and technology to grow their business and their income. The SMEs we work with are often retailers who run independent stores, outlets and kiosks, or micro-entrepreneurs making sales in the streets or house-to-house.
Creating opportunities through inclusivity
Unilever has long been a passionate advocate for greater diversity and inclusion. We are proud to have achieved gender balance across our management globally, but there is more work to do – for women and also for other under-represented groups. These include people with disabilities, those from LGBTQI+ communities and from under-represented racial and ethnic groups.
We will adopt progressive policies and practices which eliminate bias and discrimination to create a culture that’s equitable for everyone. For a start, we will remove barriers and bias in recruitment and make our leaders accountable for supporting employees to excel. Beyond our own operations, by 2025, we will spend €2 billion annually with SMEs that are owned and managed by people from diverse and under-represented communities, supporting them with access to skills, financing and networking opportunities.
We will also address the lack of representation of these audiences in our advertising. In particular, we’ll use the strength of our brands to help tackle the prevalence of stereotypes that are often perpetuated through advertising and promote a more inclusive representation of people.
Preparing people for the future of work
As we help to build a more equitable and inclusive society, we recognise that changes to the world of work will affect the employment prospects of many people. Many current ways of working – roles, places, hours and skills – are rapidly evolving.
So we will ensure that all our employees have a future-fit skillset, by 2025, to help them further their careers, whether that’s within or outside Unilever. We will also pioneer new employment models by 2030 that allow people to choose how they want to work. These could include flexible contracts that retain full-time benefits, or time off to study or retrain.
Beyond our organisation, we will help equip 10 million young people with essential skills to prepare them for job opportunities, by 2030. For example, we’re working with partners on LevelUp – a youth employability platform – that will provide a one-stop shop for young people to discover their purpose and access training, volunteering and work experience opportunities.
A healthy society for a healthy business
Inclusion is at the heart of the global sustainable development agenda, with its central ambition being to ‘leave no one behind’. So building diversity and inclusion within and beyond our business supports a range of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This has been part of our DNA since Unilever was formed more than a century ago. And it’s integral to our strategy today: to contribute to a fairer and more socially inclusive world with brands that champion human rights, stand up for equality and distribute value fairly.
We’re proud of the positive impact we have had over the years, but we’ve so much more to do. Which is why we’re setting out these bold new commitments to raise the living standards of people in our business and across our value chain, especially those who are currently under-represented.
As Alan Jope says: “We believe the actions we are committing to will make Unilever a better, stronger business ready for the huge societal changes we are experiencing today – changes that will only accelerate. Without a healthy society, there cannot be a healthy business.”
Decisive and collective action is needed to build a society that promotes cohesion, embraces diversity, nurtures talent, offers opportunities for everyone and helps to improve livelihoods.

Too many people are undervalued. Too many people don’t earn a living wage. Too many people are held back. Help us build a more equitable and inclusive world by sharing our announcement on social media.

Applying for a job with us – just got faster and more fun
text Around the world, our Research & Development team comprises 59% women, including 51% of our managerial roles. But this puts Unilever very much in the minority.
In STEM fields – science, technology, engineering and maths – women are significantly under-represented. According to data from the World Economic Forum (WEF), just 30% of the world’s researchers are women, and less than a third of female students choose to study maths or engineering in higher education.
“I am very proud of our R&D team and the many examples of our incredible women in science. Although today is International Day of Women and Girls in Science, ensuring more women choose careers in STEM is not something that should be talked about on one day alone,” says Unilever’s Chief R&D Officer Richard Slater.
“My ask is for all of us who work in STEM, especially those of us in leadership roles, to consider how we can interest more girls and young women in STEM early on and how we can improve the level of engagement and support throughout their education, internships and careers. It is essential to have diversity in management and leadership positions within STEM, not just as a source of stronger creativity and innovation, but also to ensure there are role models to inspire those setting out on their careers as the next generation of leaders,” he adds.
More role models, fewer stereotypes
Entrenched gender stereotypes and gender bias are often part of the problem. It’s said that we can’t be what we can’t see. And with recent research finding that just 12% of movie characters with STEM jobs are played by women, it’s clear that it’s time to put more role models in the spotlight.
That’s exactly what we’re doing here, to mark the UN’s International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
Meet Babita, who grew up in remote, rural India and defied stereotypes and sexism to forge a successful international career.
Meet Sueli, whose childhood fantasy was to work in the fragrant Unilever soap factory near her home. Years later she brings new product innovations to market with her impressive experience in chemistry.
Meet Erica, who is passionate about ensuring women have access to accurate information when making their skincare choices – not empty promises but scientifically proven facts.
Scroll through the carousel below to hear from them, and nine other incredible women who work in science across Unilever.
Karina: Shattering stereotypes
“For as long as I can remember I have been curious about finding solutions to life’s problems. I learned not to accept the stereotype and expectations imposed on girls. Questioning the stereotype of what a scientist should look like was my greatest recipe for success.
“I’ve worked as a food scientist for 22 years. One of the things I love about my job is that I get to work with so many brilliant minds, within Unilever and in our broader ecosystem. It is amazing to see the inventiveness and disruption that individuals aligned around the same goal can create.”
Karina Zimerfeld is Vice President of R&D in our Unilever Food Solutions business, based at our Hive Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands.
Serena: Following her passion
“The biggest challenge I have faced in my journey in science has been the unconscious bias of some of my women professors. Because I was also very good at literature and languages, they found it weird that I wanted to study pharmaceutical chemistry, so they questioned my choice.
“I decided to follow my passion. And I definitely don’t regret doing so. I have the chance to renew myself every day by learning, by developing new technologies and by solving new problems.”
Serena Pezzia is Site Leader at our R&D facility in Casale, Italy.
Sueli: A dream come true
“I joined Unilever’s R&D team 24 years ago, and grew up in Valinhos, a small city in Brazil, where one of Unilever’s biggest soap factories is located. As a child I used to look through the factory windows as I walked by with my mother, watching people working on the production lines and smelling the wonderful fragrances. I said to my mother that one day I’d like to become a chemist so I could work there too.
“I faced many challenges along the way and took a career break when I had my children. Eventually I was hired by Unilever and my dream came true. Since then I’ve visited our factories all over the world and I’m still as passionate as ever about my work.”
Sueli Cagliari is a Beauty and Personal Care R&D Manager, based in Valinhos, Brazil.
Rosela: The foodie
“I have always been passionate about science and food. It’s a no-brainer that I took this career path and I’m grateful to be working in the field that I’m most passionate about.
“As an R&D person I have always applied science in my work. In finding better solutions or creating and developing new products, there is always a science behind it. Science has unlocked so many learnings for me and it’s a continuous journey. “Science is the foundation of my work and the source of my creativity.”
Rosela de los Reyes is a Senior R&D Manager in our Ice Cream division, based in Manila in the Philippines.
Sarah: The mentor
“How to get started in science? Just have a go at something. You don’t have to have it all figured out at the beginning of your career. But have a go, learn from it and see where it will take you next.
“Build your network. Look at people you admire, make contact and ask if they would be willing to mentor you. Remember one day you can do the same for others. “And stay curious. It’s what will keep your enthusiasm going throughout your career and drive you to find out new and different things.”
Sarah Leech is R&D Director at our Port Sunlight R&D Hub in the UK.
Asya: The data scientist
“I’m so proud to be a woman who works as a scientist. And to any young women I say if science is what you want to pursue, just go for it. No matter what.
“It’s true that the majority of colleagues around you will be men. That might feel discouraging. But that’s exactly the reason why more women are needed for careers in science.
“I’m data scientist, and my passion is bringing digital solutions to complex problems. Seeing how the outcome of my work amazes people and makes an impact is definitely worth all my hard work.”
Asya Ilhan is a Data Scientist based at our Hive Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands.
Vezekile: Improving lives
“My primary purpose in life is to use science to improve the lives of our communities, especially the poor and marginalised.
“I was born the 20th child of 21, in a polygamous family, raised in remote, rural villages. After obtaining a doctorate in chemical engineering, I’ve supported others by promoting scientific careers for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and founding a social enterprise that helps elderly women.”
Vezekile Dladla is a Consumer Technical Insights Assistant Manager, based in Durban, South Africa.
Intan Shuhada: The creative thinker
“Science is all about discovery and creative thinking. It really helps to broaden your understanding and appreciation of the world around you. It equips you with excellent problem-solving abilities and extremely transferable skills.
“Science is a vast field and concerns almost everything that our eyes can see and cannot see. It’s vital to ensure the survival of our planet by developing new or alternative solutions for everything we do. Your contribution as a future scientist can play a fascinating and crucial role in that.”
Intan Shuhada Md Yunus is a Regulatory Affairs Assistant Manager, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Neetu: Protecting the planet
“What excites me most about my work is the difference it makes in people’s lives by simplifying everyday challenges. Working in science can be tough sometimes, but a great way to stay motivated is to find people who inspire you.”
“It’s vital to instil interest and increase the involvement of girls in the field of science and future innovations. To young women I would say don’t let anyone take away your imagination, creativity and curiosity.
“With an emerging need to make this planet safer for human survival and sustainability, we need more and more women to come forward and contribute in the fields of STEM.”
Neetu Verma is a Country Category Business Lead, R&D, based in Mumbai, India.
Erica: The skincare specialist
“The world is facing an unprecedented health and environmental crisis. The largest economic disaster since the great depression. Only by developing science can we solve these tough problems, promote economic and social development, and bring people happy and healthy lives.
“Just like our world, our skin is also facing new challenges. Blue light, pollution, psychological stress, for example. Social media means people find misinformation about how to treat this. I believe, as a skin care scientist, we have a responsibility and an opportunity to educate consumers with the right knowledge so they can select the right products.”
Erica Liang is a Senior R&D Manager, based in Shanghai, China.
Sarah: The visionary
“What I love about science is bringing science to life in a product and making a difference to its properties, performance, sensorial qualities or design. “Science is about asking the right questions, based on our intuition. Using data and information. Hypothesising. Experimenting.
“Nowadays data science and digital modelling bring new chances and opportunities to nurture the triangle of intuition, experience and facts. This is driving product development for a better planet, and people make this work meaningful and relevant. Better products for everyone need to come from everyone.”
Sarah Schueddekopf is Head of R&D in DACH region for our Beauty & Personal Care division, based in Hamburg, Germany.
Babita: The adventurer
“The journey to where I stand today has been an adventure. I grew up in a very low-income family in remote north-east India in the 1980s and 1990s. I was the first in my family to graduate but back then a career for a woman was not a priority. And a role in science, even less so.
“After finishing my master’s in theoretical physics, I took another adventure: doing my PhD at a chemistry lab that was dominated by men. I did everything to prove myself as good as them despite their lack of support. Eventually I took a placement in the USA, where I learned the benefit of working in a diverse environment and the value of collaboration. I published 15 articles and filed three patents.
“Now, at Unilever, my role involves developing an innovation ecosystem for R&D. Looking back at how far I have come, it all feels like a dream.”
Babita Baruwati is an Open Innovation Manager, based in Bangalore, India.
text It’s fair to say that 2020 has been a year like no other. Dominated by a pandemic which has affected us all in one way or another, lives and economies continue to be turned upside-down. Thankfully, there appears to be a chink of light at the end of this very long tunnel, with vaccines starting to become available.
In the year that Unilever turned 90, we have drawn on our resources and expertise as a global, purpose-led business to help people manage through the crisis. And while that has been a major focus, we have also made good progress on other important issues that matter to us all and, at the same time, announced some bold new commitments.
As 2020 draws to a close, we look back at some of our key moments from the past year.
1. We supported individuals, communities and businesses through the pandemic
We announced a set of measures to support global and national efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic – to protect lives and livelihoods. We committed to providing free soap, sanitiser, bleach and food to the value of €100 million to consumers and communities. We offered €500 million of cash-flow relief to support customers and suppliers across our extended value chain. And we committed to protect the pay of our employees and contractors.
These big measures filtered down to a host of on-the-ground initiatives. For instance, we partnered with charities and NGOs to get product donations to those most in need – our United for America programme is a good example. We joined forces with the UK government to target a billion people with a handwashing behaviour change campaign. And we scaled up our hand sanitiser business – from two factories in January to 61 in May – to meet global demand.
2. We marked ten years of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan
In 2010, we set out to become the world’s most sustainable business with the launch of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). With far-reaching goals, this was a game-changer for us, and for others. And we’re proud of the positive impacts we’ve made.
For instance, we’ve reached 1.3 billion people through our health and hygiene programmes, and helped over 2.3 million women access initiatives aiming to promote their safety, develop their skills or expand their opportunities.
3. We announced new actions to help protect climate and nature
As the world turned its attention to Covid-19, the focus shifted from a far greater and ever-present threat to people and the planet: the climate and nature crisis. We announced ambitious new commitments and actions to fight climate change, protect and regenerate nature, and preserve resources for future generations.
These include a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023 and net zero emissions from all our products by 2039. As part of this, our brands will collectively invest €1 billion in a fund which will be used to take meaningful and decisive action.
4. We launched a vision to reimagine the future of cleaning
In addition to our Climate & Nature announcement, we launched Clean Future – an innovation strategy that will fundamentally change the way that our cleaning and laundry products are created, manufactured and packaged.
At its heart is the ambition to replace 100% of the carbon derived from fossil fuels in our product formulations with renewable or recycled carbon by 2030. As part of this, Omo launched its cleanest, greenest products yet by incorporating plant-based stain removers.
5. We committed to making planet-friendly food an appetising option
We launched our Future Foods initiative: our plan to help people transition towards healthier diets and reduce the environmental impact of the food chain. In it we commit to an annual €1 billion sales target from plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, and continuing to lower calories, salt and sugar across all our products. Also, by 2025, we will halve food waste in our direct operations and double the number of products that deliver positive nutrition.
6. We made progress on tackling plastic waste
We reported on our progress against the pledge we made in October last year that by 2025 we would halve the use of virgin plastic in our packaging and remove more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic entirely.
We’re on track to deliver on our promises. For example, post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) now accounts for more than 10% of our plastics footprint. Our goal is at least 25% by 2025. As part of the update, we also shared our learnings on refill–reuse models for the first time.
7. We took a stand on animal testing
We’ve been developing and using non-animal approaches to assure the safety of our products for decades. But recent announcements from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) could undo the continued progress we want to see. So we joined forces with other organisations to co-sign an open letter calling for the EU Cosmetics Animal Testing Ban to be upheld as intended.
8. We stepped up our use of technology to end deforestation
To ensure that the land used to grow crops such as palm and soy isn’t connected to deforestation, we’re reimagining our approach to traceability. We launched a pilot with US company Orbital Insight which uses geolocation data to give us a clearer picture of where harvested crops are coming from. This, in turn, allows us to predict – and act on – issues such as deforestation. This pilot – alongside our new partnership with Google Cloud – is another step towards building a digital ecosystem that will help us monitor our supply chain even more closely.
9. We achieved greater gender balance within our business
We’re on a longstanding mission to drive gender equality in the workplace, and we reached a target of 50% of all managerial roles across our global business being held by women. This delivers on a goal we set in 2010, when women accounted for 38% of our managerial roles.
Since then we have introduced a series of programmes, partnerships and policies – all designed to support women within the company and break down barriers to their recruitment, retention and development.
10. We moved to 100% renewable grid electricity globally
And finally, we go back to the very start of the year. On 1 January, we announced that all our factories, offices, R&D facilities, data centres, warehouses and distribution centres were using 100% renewable grid electricity. We’re pleased to reach that milestone, but now we’re going further and working to get our entire energy use from renewable sources. Our goal is to become entirely carbon neutral across the business before 2030.
How will we be taking action next year?
As we continue our efforts to look after people and contribute to a more inclusive society, we will also continue to help tackle some of the world’s biggest issues – like the climate emergency and plastic waste – by using our influence to drive change at a global level.
But there’s also a lot we can all do as individuals to make a difference.
That's why we launched our Take Action Hub, which brings together initiatives from various partners, NGOs and other organisations around the world. There’s a whole range of actions to get involved with, from global petitions to local volunteering.
text As the world continues to fight Covid-19, a shadow pandemic is on the rise. According to the United Nations, cases of domestic violence during lockdown have increased by 20%.
Even before the additional strains put on individuals by Covid-19, UN figures indicate that 35% of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. On top of this, fear and stigma can mean that as many as 60% of cases go unreported.
Domestic violence can be physical or psychological, and it can affect anyone of any age, gender, race or sexual orientation. The human cost is immeasurable. But alongside the physical and emotional toll, there is a significant economic impact. Loss of income, absenteeism and a fall in productivity financially impacts individuals and their families and society at large.
An opportunity for businesses to take action
“One-third of our adult lives is spent at work,” says Aline Santos, EVP, Marketing and Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer. “This puts employers like Unilever in a unique position to create a workplace culture where people know they can access support safely and securely.
“We have pledged to proactively create a safe and inclusive workplace,” she adds. “One where employees can seek help without stigma and where staff have access to basic training to know how to respond appropriately if they feel a colleague is potentially at risk.
“All of this is detailed in our Global Domestic Violence and Abuse Policy (PDF 115.08 KB) which ensures staff are provided with access to ‘safe leave’, flexible working conditions and access to counselling and support services should they ever need them,” she adds.
To this end, in a business first on International Women’s Day, Unilever is offering businesses and organisations open access to its policy and how it supports colleagues who have experienced abuse. “We hope that by sharing what we have learnt shaping our policy, it will help employers that currently don’t have anything in place,” Aline says.
Learning the power of speaking out from #MeToo’s Tarana Burke
Domestic abuse thrives in secrecy. Creating an environment where people felt able to disclose their experience without stigma was a powerful lesson that was brought to light by the #MeToo movement.
To continue our learning in this space, founder of the #MeToo movement Tarana Burke will take part in a LinkedIn live with Aline Santos on 4 March.
The event will also see the launch of #Unmute, a campaign urging action to end the silence on domestic violence.
Speaking out to end the silence
“Our work to tackle domestic abuse is a long-term commitment,” says Aline. “Beyond marking International Women’s Day, we will work to provide ongoing support for employees who disclose abuse. We’ll also add our voice to end the silence on domestic violence and ensure that we can raise awareness of resources such as the UN’s Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls.
“Through these initiatives we hope to encourage people inside and outside Unilever to speak out and help victims of domestic violence be heard,” she says. “Together we can work towards a future in which violence towards any human becomes a thing of the past.”

text Whether it’s from a spoon, a cone, on a stick or in a dish, our brands have been finding innovative ways to serve up delicious, indulgent ice creams and frozen treats that create happy memories for consumers for more than 100 years.
“As the maker of iconic and adored brands, we are constantly looking at trends and innovations to bring frozen treat lovers new experiences that they will enjoy,” says Vice President, Unilever Ice Cream North America, Russel Lilly.
And for good reason. Markets are buoyant, in the US, 45% of consumers of frozen treats say ice cream is their favourite indulgence, with sales in North America exceeding $12 billion annually. In Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), consumption is around 4.6kg per year. And sales from new, innovative products accounts for a bigger part compared to other food product categories.
The secret sauce to successful ice cream innovation
Developing a new ice cream innovation can be a whole lot of fun, but it also requires a great deal of teamwork. “It takes an entire village of consumer insight experts, R&D and marketing teams to really drive meaningful ice cream innovation,” says Glenn Handoko, Global Brand Manager for Wall’s Classics and Masterbrands. “But we all start by putting the consumer’s needs first.”
“That means finding out what they’re looking for and what their current solution to that problem is. Then we hit the drawing board and focus on five key areas of incremental innovation – size, flavour, format, sub-brand, and brand innovation – to see if we can help address it or give them something better.”
And that strategy is delivering results. “This year, we’re excited to introduce inventive flavours, increased variety and reimagined takes on classics to your favourite retailers,” says Russel Lilly. “We’ve also expanded our popular lines to create products that will bring joy all year long.”
Read on to find out how the teams flexed each of the five areas to bring five fresh new product lines to market in 2021–2022.
Size – Indulgent, plant-based minis of Magnum bestsellers 
While the uptick in vegan diets provided Magnum with a strong case for extending its much-loved classic range to include plant-based alternatives; vegans are not the only consumers attracted to a non-dairy offering.
In a Euromonitor survey, nearly 40% of people said they are looking to plant-based dairy alternatives to ‘feel healthier’. Other reasons include: “I digest them better”. Add to this mix, 44.8% of Gen Z consumers who snack up to twice a day and 49.4% of whom choose ice cream when they do, and you have a set of data that saw the brand teams look to flex size and plant-based as part of their innovation mix.
Vegan Magnum Mini Classics were launched in January 2022 as a multi-pack including three mini bars of classic and almond vegan flavours. The range, with PETA award-winning flavours, has proved a hit with consumers and has now been rolled out to the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, the Nordics, and Central and Eastern Europe.
Talenti Pairings offer treats from more than one category 
Boomer consumers might be happy with a scoop of vanilla but the same cannot be said for Millennials and Gen Z foodies. Two in five are keen to explore candy “mash-ups” and hybrid desserts.
“We also know US consumers have two ways of eating packaged ice cream,” says Talenti’s Associate Innovation Marketing Manager, Tony Patrignelli, “some dig their way to the bottom of the pint before advancing horizontally, while one-third eat horizontally, scraping layer by layer off the top until all the ice cream is gone.”
Using these insights, the teams worked with chefs, mixologists and culinary creators to produce a dessert range for the scrapers. Borrowing trends from desserts and cocktails, the team developed Talenti Pairings, two expertly paired flavours in one jar, which could stand alone but together create a striking new flavour experience.
Consumers can choose from Strawberry Margarita, Bourbon Fudge Brownie, Salted Chocolate Churro or Caramel Pretzel Blondie. And while it’s early days, consumer engagement has been strong. Social posts for Talenti Pairings have recorded the highest hits the brand has seen in the last two years. It’s confident this positive sentiment will add to the brand’s 4.3% share of packaged ice cream in the US and sixth place ranking in the marketplace.
Format – Ben & Jerry’s parlour-style sundaes that can be enjoyed on your sofa
Memories of family holidays and favourite treats can go a long way towards driving customer decision-making. And nothing speaks more to childhood holidays than the indulgence of ice cream parlour-style sundaes, the ultimate ‘original’ dessert where you got the chance to pick the topping of your choice.
But ice cream is no longer just a summer treat; 48% of consumers have a stock in their freezer all year round. It’s also no longer an out-of-home experience; research shows there’s an uptick in people self-treating in the form of a premium tub, consumed in the evenings after dinner or on the sofa. 
With this in mind, Ben & Jerry’s team worked to create four new sundaes (three dairy and one non-dairy), tapping into flavours including hazelnut, berries and banoffee pie. An extra dash of creativity saw the addition of a whipped style topping that references the cream toppings of parlour sundaes but lightens the mouthfeel.
“Consumers have been loving these uber-indulgent new sundaes across Europe in 2022. Launched in the UK in January, all three dairy flavours achieved spots in the top ten highest-performing summer innovations in ice cream, with Cookie Vermont-ster even grabbing the number 1 spot,” says Niels Tigges, Product Marketing Manager Europe.
Sub-brand – Magnum’s fashionable flavour twists bring new audiences to classics 
Remixing classics is a theme of 2022, from Elton and Britney Spears taking Tiny Dancer back into the charts to TikTok foodies putting their own stamp on traditional recipes such as macaroni cheese.
This summer, Magnum joined the party, bringing pop icons Kylie Minogue and Peggy Gou to the Cannes Festival to launch a set of fashionable flavour twists to three all-time favourites in its bestselling stick range with a K-pop inspired club remix of Kylie’s classic track ‘Can’t get you out of my head’.
Magnum’s ice-cream stick launches include Magnum Almond Remix, featuring a duo swirled almond flavour and Madagascan vanilla ice cream, encased in luxurious white chocolate with chopped almond pieces and half-dipped in cracking milk chocolate; Magnum White Chocolate and Berry Remix pairing berry and Madagascan vanilla ice cream, coated in white chocolate and half-dipped in classic milk chocolate. And last but not least, its Magnum Classic Remix featuring chocolate ice cream swirled with Madagascan vanilla ice cream, fully dipped classic milk chocolate and half-dipped in milk chocolate combined with crunchy cocoa pieces.
In all remixes, whether it’s lyrics or recipes, the ingredients loved by the core fan base remain the same. But those little upgrades to a premium offering can provide powerful and profitable introductions to a new, wider audience.
“Pairing classics elements loved by consumers and turning them into something new, combined with an amazing summer drove outstanding performance for Remix double ; Almond Remix is the N°1 NPD of the ice cream category in France in 2022” says Elena Rakocevic, Magnum’s Brand Manager for France. In Turkey the Magnum White Chocolate and Berry Remix was the summer hit according to Hazal Kantman. “We saw outstanding performance of more than 50% higher vs last year innovation’s Magnum Gold Caramel,” she says.
Brand – Twister Peek-a-Blue provides a fruity update to a kids’ favourite 
“We want to give the best and, for us, that’s fun and tasty ice creams that kids will love but also that parents approve of. That means all our innovations for this young audience come with guard rails including strict adherence to Unilever nutritional commitments,” says Glenn Handoko. “Every children’s ice cream portion we make has a maximum of 110 calories, 12 grams of sugar and 3 grams of saturated fat.”
Creating a new take on Twister ice creams, a firm kids’ favourite, saw the brand team create a fun shape that references the original but with Twister’s core shape reimagined to look like twisted, braided strips of ice cream. Real fruit purée and fruit juice concentrates were used to keep a cap on calories and deliver a delicious melon and strawberry flavour combination.
The result is Twister Peek-a-Blue which comes in at 66 calories per portion. And with Mintel research telling us that 41% of consumers would like to see more desserts and confections that are naturally sweetened (with honey or fruit), these single-servings of snacks may become a firm favourite for all the family.
Post-launch sales across Europe are promising, with the product taking the number two and number three spot for in-home ice cream sales in the UK and Ireland, and ranking third in out-of-home ice cream sales in Germany.
text The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) exist to give countries and companies a sure-fire way of prioritising their efforts to focus on the social, environmental and governance issues that need the most attention over the next 15 years.
Of course, meeting the SDGs is a tough ask and progress can be slow. But they are seen as a positive way of creating a life of dignity and opportunity for all – while offering a huge potential to boost profitable growth for businesses everywhere, working within the boundaries of the planet.
Unlike their predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals which focused largely on how rich nations could help developing nations overcome their challenges, the SDGs apply equally to everyone, everywhere – not just governments, but business and civil society too.
So, how can businesses use them?
Yes, the challenges presented by the 17 Global Goals will impact on businesses. But rather than see them as problems or growth limiters, companies should see the meeting of the targets as the biggest growth opportunity in a generation.
“Every business will benefit from operating in a more equitable, resilient world if we achieve the SDGs,” says Unilever CEO, Paul Polman. “We have an opportunity to unlock trillions of dollars through new markets, investments and innovation. But to do so, we must challenge our current practices and address poverty, inequality and environmental challenges.”
But putting the SDGs at the heart of corporate strategy – with internal targets and policies, and the development of new products and services designed to meet the Goals – demands a change in mindset. However, doing well and doing good is now even more possible thanks to the Goals.
While not all of the Goals will apply to any one business, the list is designed to better direct public and private investment to where it’s needed most, helping companies to identify what types of innovation, technology or solutions are needed now to help them grow sustainably.
Three companies that are using the SDGs for good reason
The Goals have so far been positively adopted by many businesses, either to validate existing approaches to grappling with sustainability issues, or to support the development of new business models, products and services – but there is still much more to do.
Here are just a few examples of companies that are using the Global Goals to underpin their approach to sustainability:
1. Grundfos
In Kenya, more than 16 million people – 36% of the population – do not have access to clean drinking water. Realising the opportunity to grow its business across Africa, and to respond to Global Goal 6, water engineering firm Grundfos has helped Nairobi’s local water board to improve the capacity of its water services. Now, hundreds of thousands of city inhabitants can access a ‘water ATM’, which uses the company’s AQtap technology, and pay for their water use via mobile technology provided in partnership with Safaricom.
In the next five years, the business aims to reach 2 million people worldwide using a similar approach in places like India, Thailand and Bangladesh. “We’re generating great branding for Grundfos, which creates lots of credibility with decision makers because we’re doing a good job, which helps attract new business,” says Rasoul Mikkelsen, Director of Global Partnerships at Grundfos.
2. Unilever
The SDGs manifest themselves in many of the Unilever brands. For example, addressing Global Goal 6, Unilever’s Lifebuoy soap brand has set about improving the hand-washing habits of 1 billion people – reducing the incidence of child deaths by as much as 44%, and boosting sales in countries with the highest rates of diarrhoea-related child deaths, such as India and Pakistan. “Public–private partnerships are crucial to achieve the SDGs, with health organisations and governments having the expertise to deliver messages in a scalable and sustainable way,” says Anila Gopal, Lifebuoy’s Global Social Mission Director.
3. Safaricom
Global Goal 16 calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Safaricom’s response has been to work with political parties and content service providers across Kenya to make sure that inflammatory messages are not broadcast through bulk messaging services, as was the case in the aftermath of 2007 elections, resulting in large-scale violence between ethnically and politically opposing sides. The move has cut operating risks and strengthened brand recognition as a company willing to take up issues of national importance.
text About the author
Former CEO, Unilever
Paul Polman has been CEO of Unilever since January 2009. Under his leadership, the company has a ambitious vision to decouple its growth from its overall environmental footprint and increase its positive social impact through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.
Modern life is built on trust. No society can thrive without it – and in purely business terms, trust is our most valuable asset, the basis of our prosperity.
What’s more, trust is the key to unlocking the sort of progress we all want to see – addressing climate change, tackling poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality. These ambitions, embodied in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will only be achieved by people working together in new, deeply collaborative ways. That kind of co-operation depends on the highest levels of trust.
But, all over the world, trust is under threat. Polls consistently show trust in many institutions is at an all-time low – and it is hardly surprising. Why should people trust a system that leaves so many of them behind?
So, what can business do? I believe it should take the lead in building, protecting and repaying trust. That’s a huge task – and I don’t think Unilever, or any other individual business, has all the answers. But I do think a good place to start is a recognition of what trust is, and why it matters to us.
€100bn The value of Unilever’s trust and reputation
What do we mean when we talk about trust?
Trust is our most important value driver. Unilever’s current market capitalisation is €130 billion – but our asset value is only €30 billion. The balance is made up by trust, or reputation – an extraordinarily valuable asset, built by generations of Unilever people, by our values and by great products.
It makes business sense to protect and nurture your most valuable assets. In the case of trust, how do we do that?
There is a temptation to focus on things that businesses often think of as under their direct control – products, service, delivery.
Improving all these things is critically important, of course – you cannot be trusted if you do not deliver what you promise. But they are not enough on their own.
When people talk about trustworthiness, they mean much more: values, fairness, equality, purpose. They expect business to look outwards, at its role in the world. They think about behaviour – and they take a long-term view of whether a business is ‘walking the talk’.
In a global climate of distrust, we have to work twice as hard to maintain the reputation we have earned. And then we have to work even harder, to seize the opportunities that building trust can bring.
Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever
Building trust, creating opportunities
Unilever has always been a business founded on purpose – and in our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), we set out our commitment to ensuring that business success should be long term, sustainable and not come at the expense of people or the planet.
This has contributed hugely to the fact that we have built up reserves of trust, reflected in surveys on trust and reputation such as GlobeScan’s annual Sustainability Leaders Survey, in which we’ve held top spot for the last seven years.
But reputation has a habit of arriving on foot and departing on horseback. In a global climate of distrust, we have to work twice as hard to maintain the reputation we have earned. And then, with others, we have to work even harder, to seize the opportunities that building trust can bring.
Transforming business to transform the world
Nurturing trust brings about direct opportunities for any business. Trust builds better relationships with consumers and suppliers, greater business resilience and more engaged employees. Recent research suggests, for example, that when people believe they are working for a trustworthy organisation, they will invest even more to exceed the company’s goals.
It is also about the wider opportunities. Achieving the trillions of dollars of growth that could be unlocked by the global sustainable development agenda will mean everyone – governments, agencies, business and NGOs – mobilising their collective will and resources on a basis of trust.
Business has a good starting point, as well as clear incentives. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, 75% of people say that they trust their own company. Two-thirds of respondents say they want CEOs to take the lead on policy change instead of waiting for governments, which in most countries now rank significantly below business in the trust rankings.
75% of respondents to the Edelman Trust Barometer say they trust the company they work for
Transparency: open with ourselves, open with others
So, how can businesses build on the trust people have in them to achieve both these commercial and developmental opportunities? The key is to stick to the values on which the business is founded and which binds the organisation together in common purpose. Openness and transparency – including sharing relevant data – will also play a huge part. We need to be open about not having all the answers. And we need to work harder to listen to, and act on, other people’s perspectives.
When we launched our USLP in 2010, for example, we set ourselves ambitious targets to achieve social and environmental impacts. Each year, we report on all of our commitments – and our 2017 progress is described here.
We’ve made enormous progress in many areas – but we’re open about the fact that we’ve made less progress in others. By being transparent about what we’ve learnt, we hope to help others who are on the same journey, and get the benefit of their perspective on ours. And since one of our biggest lessons is that progress depends on the kind of transformational change that can only be achieved through partnerships, we want those partnerships to be based on the strongest possible foundations: ones built on trust.
Taking the lead
By adopting a transparent, open approach, business has the opportunity – and responsibility – to lead by example.
Building trust strengthens an individual business. And by helping to achieve the SDGs and contributing to fairer societies, we have the chance to reverse the years of declining trust and build a better, more prosperous world. That’s a prize no business can afford to ignore.
text Our business is growing – and our latest results continue to show that our growth is sustainable, as well as profitable.
Each year, we report on our progress towards the goals we set ourselves in our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). Launched in 2010 it is the roadmap for our vision of accelerating our growth while reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our positive social impact.
Here are five things you should know about our progress for 2016, including the successes we've achieved and the big challenges that still remain.
We're seeing sustainability driving higher rates of growth...
...showing that our growth is consistent and competitive, as well as profitable and sustainable. Our 'sustainable living brands' – which all contribute to one or more of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan targets and have a clear sustainable living purpose – delivered over 60% of our growth in 2016. What's more, they grew more than 50% faster than the rest of the business. We now have 18 sustainable living brands – and they include our six biggest brands by turnover.
We're having positive social impacts on millions of lives...
...and we use every part of our value chain to deliver them. For example, we've helped around 920,000 women to access initiatives that aimed to promote their safety, develop their skills and expand their opportunities. We achieved this by working with our supply chain, and through initiatives that focused on selling and distributing our products. By the end of 2016 we will have helped 538 million people improve their health and hygiene, and around 650,000 smallholder farmers access initiatives aimed at improving their agricultural practices or incomes.
We've made great progress reducing environmental impacts in our factories and operations, though we still face challenges beyond them...
...because addressing some of the impact of how consumers use our products is taking time. Since 2008, in our manufacturing operations, we've cut CO2 from energy by 43%, water abstraction by 37% and total waste disposed of by 96% per tonne of production. Since 2010, the water impact of our products has reduced by around 7%, while the waste associated with consumer disposal of our products has reduced by around 28%.
But the greenhouse gas impact of our products across their lifecycle, including consumer use, has now increased by around 8% since 2010. Despite the challenges, we remain fully committed to a value chain approach and being carbon positive in our own operations.
We're willing to expand our commitments where we need to...
...as we did in January 2017, when we announced that we're committed to ensuring that all of our plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. We've also continued to embed human rights further into our business, and in 2016 integrated our human rights expertise into our supply chain organisation.
While there's more we need to do, we're confident we're on the right path...
...because our business model, with the USLP at its heart, continues to create value for us, for our shareholders, and for millions of people around the world. We have consistently grown ahead of our markets, steadily improved profitability and cash flow, and delivered strong shareholder returns since the USLP was launched.

text We are eight years into our Sustainable Living Plan and have made significant progress across many of our targets.
Watch our film below or visit our highlights page to find out more.
We have also learnt a lot during that time. Not least that new technologies, new business models and new ways of thinking are all vital to creating the change the world needs – quickly and at scale.
While we still face many challenges and we don’t have all the answers, it’s clear that doing things differently will continue to be a key driver of our growth.
“'Making Sustainable Living Commonplace' will remain our purpose as a company”, says our CEO Alan Jope, “and we will use this to keep Unilever at the forefront of ensuring business is a force for good. More and more of our brands will become explicit about the positive social and environmental impact they have. This is entirely aligned to the instincts of our people and to the expectations of our consumers. It is not about putting purpose ahead of profits, it is purpose that drives profits.”
Here are just a few ways we’re innovating for impact.
Breakthrough steps towards a circular economy for plastics
As a packaged goods company we are acutely aware of the impact of plastic packaging on the environment. We’re pioneering new technologies and business models to further our strategy of using less plastic, better plastic and even no plastic at all. And where we do use plastic, we’re committed to transitioning to a circular economy.
In Indonesia, we’re piloting a breakthrough technology on multi-layer plastics used in sachets. This aims to turn used sachets into new polymers on a commercial basis. If successful, it could herald a way to make sachet recycling more circular for us, and for industry as a whole.
We’re innovating business models, too. In January, we announced a partnership with Loop, a waste-free shopping pilot, where products are shipped directly to consumers, then returned and refilled. Some of our brands have developed new formats for the platform, such as refillable deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets.
Meeting the water challenge through innovation
Our biggest water impact happens when consumers use our products to shower, bathe or clean their clothes. And that’s a challenge, because while we’ve had some success with behaviour change programmes designed to reduce use, progress hasn’t been fast enough. So we’re developing new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or even no water at all.
For example, we came up with the innovative Domestos Flush Less toilet spray, which disinfects and eliminates malodours without the need to flush. Since each flush uses about 9 litres of water, this novel yet simple solution has the potential to make a big impact in water-scarce regions.
We also launched our Love Beauty and Planet range, whose conditioners use innovative technology which helps them break down into smaller molecules and rinse out faster. This gives consumers the opportunity to go easy on the tap and cut down their shower time to save water.
Boosting incomes and livelihoods, especially for women
We have the potential to positively impact the lives of millions through our value chain. One important group is small-scale retailers in emerging markets, who are often women. It’s here that innovations in digital and e-commerce can really unlock barriers to improving incomes and growth, building on our Shakti model.
Our Jaza Duka initiative in Kenya – a partnership with Mastercard – digitises the processes of buying supplies and selling goods, allowing retailers to build the credentials to access bank loans. This gives them better control of their inventory, so they can stock up to meet consumer demand.
Kasha – an initiative within our TRANSFORM partnership – is another example. This e-commerce and content platform in Rwanda confidentially sells and delivers women’s health and personal care products through a novel distribution system that empowers women and enables growth.
Harnessing the power of plants for healthier diets
We’ve made good progress on reformulating our products to reduce salt, sugar and fat – 48% of our portfolio by volume now meets our Highest Nutritional Standards, based on globally recognised dietary guidelines.
Today, more and more people want to increase the proportion of their diet that contains plant-based foods made with natural ingredients. Meeting this consumer demand fits perfectly with our vision of sustainable business growth, and our portfolio kept growing in 2018.
For example, we are increasing our offering of vegan/non-dairy products. Ben & Jerry’s, Cornetto, Magnum and Breyers all have non-dairy variants. And in 2018, we acquired The Vegetarian Butcher, which aims to be the largest butcher in the world through its plant-based portfolio.
Good progress but much more to do
We are making good progress overall against our targets, but we recognise that some will be difficult to achieve by the end of 2020. That doesn’t mean we’ll give up.
Waste is a prime example. Our waste footprint per consumer use has reduced by 31% since 2010. We have made good progress in areas where we have direct control, such as reducing waste in our own operations and through alternative packaging design. In areas beyond our direct control, progress has been slower, despite active lobbying to drive up collection and recycling infrastructure. We will accelerate our efforts on packaging and driving up demand for recycled content.
text Thursday 12 November is World Quality Day. But providing consumers with high-quality products that they trust and enjoy is something we’re committed to around the clock all year, in every part of our global business.
To discuss how trust and transparency are vital to sustainable homecare brand Seventh Generation, Unilever’s Chief Quality Officer Sabina Krzystolik caught up with Seventh Generation’s CEO Joey Bergstein.
Here they talk about Seventh Generation’s commitment to safeguarding the planet for the future, and the impact that philosophy has on everything from product formulas to packaging.
We need to inspire people with sustainable solutions that make their lives easier. Joey Bergstein, CEO of Seventh Generation 
Sabina Krzystolik: Joey, thank you for joining me today. Having built your career in big consumer goods companies, did your perspective on connecting with consumers change after joining Seventh Generation?
Joey Bergstein: It absolutely did. As I came to Seventh Generation, what I was most struck by was the real need to think holistically about the products we create and the systems those products live within. The need to think about the unintended consequences of the products we are making and ensuring that we are trying to see around corners to what the future may hold for people and the planet as a whole.
SK: It sounds like the brand’s values play a big role in shaping your decision-making?
JB: They do. We have a quote on the wall in our HQ boardroom that captures the inspiration for the company. The Great Law of the Iroquois states that in our every deliberation we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations. We will never pursue an opportunity without also acknowledging first we have a much bigger responsibility for what we’re putting into the world around us.
SK: Consumer trust is becoming more and more important for businesses and brands. What does it mean to Seventh Generation?
JB: For us, trust starts with being really explicit about our formulation standards. We use a hazard-based approach. That means we don’t calculate risks on chemicals that could cause concern. We simply don’t use them at all.
Trust is also about transparency. We disclose the ingredients we use and have listed them on the back of our packs since 2008, despite that not being required by law. We believe people have a right to know what they bring into their homes and use around their families.
Trust is also built when you take important stances on behalf of people. We’ve taken stances on ingredients disclosure, on chemical safety, on climate justice. That’s not just the right thing to do, but it also creates competitive advantage when we can shift the rules of the game to the rules that we play by.
Trust is built when you go beyond your own products. When we think about our sustainability goals, we think not just about the products we’re creating but also the system that we’re creating them into. Our ‘zero waste’ goal is a good example. Our products will all be recyclable and recycled. Compostable and composted. Biodegradable and degraded. We can control half of that equation but to create a circular economy, the second part is crucial too. We need system change to close the loop.
SK: So communication with consumers is key. How are you supporting people to act more sustainably?
JB: We need to inspire people with sustainable solutions that make their lives easier. Just over a year ago, we launched ultra-concentrated laundry detergents. In the US, we sell most of our detergent in large bottles that weigh over 3kg but we wanted to stop shipping so much water across the country. We developed an 8x concentrated Easy Dose version that’s 70% lighter, uses 60% less plastic and contains 50% less water.
It has got several environmental benefits, but the thing we talk to consumers about most is the Easy Dose cap. One squeeze dispenses exactly the right amount. People love that convenience benefit – simply squeezing out one perfect measure with one hand. They get the same washes as you would from a large bottle. We’ve made it easy for people to make more sustainable choices.
SK: The market and consumer preferences are changing fast. What do you think improves the quality of consumer experience today?
JB: I think it’s about the full experience that people have. Products that work, that get the job done brilliantly and are safe for people and the planet.
Consumers also want to know who is behind the products they use and it takes only a couple of clicks to find out, and a couple more to find out about that company’s values and what it stands for. That is increasingly becoming a differentiator when it comes to the companies people want to support. And that’s why we must hold ourselves accountable for our own impact along our entire experience chain.
SK: And finally, as a consumer yourself – because we all are – what does quality mean to you?
JB: For me, it’s about the experience you have that’s so great that it makes you want to use it again. That you actually look forward to using it again. There’s no such thing as a low-involvement purchase. People engage with everything they come into contact with. There’s always an opportunity to delight somebody, to give them something they hadn’t expected and to make them want to come back for more. That’s quality.
text On any given day, 3.4 billion people use Unilever products in around 190 countries and, in each market where we operate, the emphasis is on selling our core brands to mainstream consumers.
But it was becoming clear a decade or so ago that trends like globalisation, migration, travel and digital commerce were creating new segments that were underserved by Unilever. So, in 2012, we set up Unilever International (UI) to serve these emerging – and fast-growing – geographies, consumers, customers and channels worldwide.
The unique model proved successful. In just under four years, the business more than doubled its inherited turnover and crossed the billion-euro mark in less than a decade, becoming one of Unilever’s fastest-growing businesses globally.
To mark ten years of operation, we take a look under the bonnet of this phenomenal growth engine for Unilever.
Thriving in an increasingly fragmented world
UI works alongside Unilever’s category and country teams to identify segments that are too niche, small or hard to serve, or that are non-strategic for the mainstream business. UI’s role is to fill these white spaces. Specifically, to develop and incubate brands and then, when the time is right, hand back the scaled-up businesses for the category and country teams to manage and grow further.
“Every aspect of today’s FMCG environment is fragmenting, from channels to consumer base to consumption moments,” explains Unilever International CEO Umesh Shah. “Business is growing at the edges, like discounters and super premium. To service those edges – to thrive in today’s fragmented world – you need different models to co-exist in market at the same time."

A wide-ranging remit
UI serves over 100 million consumers in small or challenging geographies like Mongolia, East Timor and Maldives. These hard-to-reach markets are served via UI’s agile supply chain and supported by in-store activation and digital marketing to help build leadership positions. Through UI’s international network, it’s able to quickly and efficiently set up distribution routes to remote locations like the North Caribbean or Pacific Islands.
The business caters to millions of diasporas and expats who crave the ethnic brands they grew up with and shoppers who want halal or kosher products. For instance, these include Bru coffee from India, Marmite from the UK and Lady’s Choice from the Philippines, as well as halal ranges from North Africa and kosher products from Israel.
UI has created a specialist multi-channel distributor network to supply to Fortune 500 companies, global hospitality and travel businesses, government institutions, military contractors and non-governmental organisations like the United Nations Development Programme and the Red Cross.
The business takes brands like Pears, St Ives, Maille and Brut outside their ‘home’ markets, as well as managing the international expansion of acquired brands such as Horlicks, Simple and Shea Moisture.
It also specialises in incubating core brands when they are new to a market. For example, in Korea, UI built winning positions for brands like Dove, Vaseline, Lipton and Ben & Jerry’s.
Launch of Lifebuoy in East Timor 
Diverse business models
To serve the hugely diverse nature of its consumer base, UI manages an equally diverse range of business models. Some markets it operates in are mature, others are in their infancy.
A good example of this is the Pacific Islands. Spanning Guam to New Zealand, East Timor to French Polynesia, the 30,000 or so islands in the region cover an area about two and a half times the size of Europe. Every market is different and even within markets, no product segment is the same.
UI leverages different business models to service different markets. This ranges from working with 500+ chosen professional distributors to going direct to key retailers like FairPrice in Singapore and Watsons in the Netherlands.
Power of digital transformation
UI’s complex global business model means it leverages technology across its value chain, from customer and supplier interfaces to digital commerce and direct-to-consumer models. Its small marketing team deploys digital expertise and assets from the main offices in Singapore to nearly 100 countries globally.
As Aseem Puri, UI’s Chief Marketing Officer, explains: “We launch all our products through digital. You can target a consumer in Papua New Guinea sitting here in Singapore. When a homemaker opens her Facebook page, she will see an Omo ad. When a millennial woman goes to Facebook, she sees a Lux ad. Digital has helped us build our brands fast and remotely.”
A launch a day
UI has perfected the art of maintaining a steady stream of launches from our top brands. In fact, it has launched between 300 and 350 products a year over the last few years – that’s almost one a day.
To make that possible, it uses an agile innovation process that uses external partners to craft new and consumer-relevant products at speed. Its New Product Distribution and Procurement teams – who manage beauty and personal care products – have landed over 1,000 innovations in the last three years alone.
As Amit Mohta, UI’s Supply Chain Head, says: “This agile development–production–launch cycle is a great way for brands to test new products that can be scaled up or simply launched faster.”
Partnerships with purpose at their heart
In the weeks after Covid-19 took hold, UI mobilised resources to scale up hand sanitiser production capabilities significantly to supply millions of Lifebuoy sanitisers, handwashes, wipes and masks to government institutions and NGOs to protect the health and hygiene of millions of people around the world.
More recently, UI’s dedicated partnerships team has built a global infrastructure to supply a range of beauty and personal care products to leading hospitality and travel players such as Intercontinental Group, Uber and Singapore Airlines. These partnerships will also help reduce our plastic footprint by replacing miniature single-use plastic amenities with our refillable large packs.
What does the future hold?
“There’s an intrinsic culture of agility, speed and can-do mindset that runs through the 400+ UI employees from 35 nationalities across its seven hubs. It’s not uncommon for millennials to manage businesses worth €15-20 million before they develop into next-generation leaders,” says Nguyen-Tam Trang, UI’s Head of Human Resources.
At the heart of everything is UI’s aim to grow white space opportunities, be it through brands or geographies – to a substantial size, then hand them over to the main business to own and scale up. And while the past ten years have seen exceptional growth, Umesh (Unilever International CEO) believes the best is yet to come.

text As part of Unilever Pakistan’s agenda to conquer the digital world, we aim to invest in owned assets that connect us directly to the consumer. One such initiative is DRAMATIME.com. For decades, Pakistan has produced quality dramas that have received global recognition and with eyeballs now shifting to digital, owning the drama platform was the right fit for us. Unilever recognizes the growth of online video content consumption and has invested in creating an online environment where the Pakistani digital audience can watch their favorite dramas anywhere, anytime.
Dramas are the most watched content category in Pakistan with a staggering base of 15 million monthly internet users, with almost half of online searches in Pakistan being for dramas. It was based on such facts that Dramatime was born. This platform will help Unilever brands to reach out to the digital age on the go drama viewer.
Dramatime is also Unilevers’s contribution to the drama industry of Pakistan as it plays a vital role in fighting piracy as all content on the website is sourced through legal means. Currently, the website hosts dramas from the nation’s largest television networks such as Hum TV Network, APlus/ATV, Express Network, TV One and Urdu1.
Shazia Syed, Chairperson and CEO - Unilever Pakistan, highlighted, “Unilever is committed to ensuring that we provide our consumers with convenient solutions for their everyday needs. We are very close to our consumers and our Pakistani heritage and this portal is a reflection of just that. It provides our consumers easy and convenient access to hundreds of beloved Urdu dramas produced by the country on a single portal and conserves our TV industry heritage through a legal platform. We are very happy to be here with our partners for the launch of this initiative today.”
Ali Tariq (CFO and Media Sponsor – Unilever Pakistan). “It’s a proud moment for Unilever Pakistan. Dramatime is our contribution towards the legalization of the entertainment and drama Industry of Pakistan”

text Unilever has been named industry leader in personal products in the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) 2020, achieving a score of 90 out of 100 across a range of 27 environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.
A benchmark for sustainability
The Index is a key tool for investors who recognise that responsible business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value.
We have been part of the DJSI since its launch in 1999 and named leader 21 times. In this year’s Index, we achieved industry top scores in 15 criteria.
ESG performance is now a core question from investors
“ESG responsibility is now a core question that portfolio managers are asking,” CEO Alan Jope told the World Economic Forum in a recent video interview.
“Finally, the penny is dropping that there is not a trade-off between doing the right thing and doing the profitable thing,” he added. “Doing the right thing is a pathway to a more profitable and more sustainable business.”
Being recognised as industry leader by the most respected independent sustainability benchmark reflects the sustainability efforts across the entire company and shows that responsible business practices are a win–win, delivering for our investors, consumers, for society and the planet.
As well as demonstrating to our stakeholders our commitment to long-term sustainable business and growth, being named industry leader means we also continue to be included in DJSI World, a global investment index which tracks leading sustainability-driven companies.

Poland is the second most homophobic country in the European Union. “LGBT+ people suffer physical or verbal abuse every day,” says Martyna Kaczmarek, Country Business Lead for Ben & Jerry’s, based in Warsaw.
Nowhere was the hostility towards the LGBT+ community more evident than in the capital’s Saviour Square where a rainbow of flowers installed to symbolise love and peace was vandalised not once but seven times.
A display of light, love and strength
Under Martyna’s leadership, Ben & Jerry’s partnered with two voluntary organisations, Milość Nie Wyklucza (which means ‘love does not exclude’) and the Fundacja Wolontariat Rowności (Rowności Volunteer Foundation) to develop an answer to this destruction.
The solution was a hologram, created using only water and light, which produced an unbreakable rainbow projected on the site of the old rainbow.
It was unveiled on the eve of the Pride celebrations on 8 June 2018. “It was one of the most beautiful moments of my life,” Martyna remembers. And she was not alone in her enthusiasm. “Proud of my city today,” said one of its first observers. “You cannot burn a real rainbow.”
Alongside wide media coverage, the unbreakable rainbow went on to win five awards at the Cannes Lions festival. But the recognition was just the icing on the cake for Martyna. “Through this rainbow display of light, love and strength, we’d like to show the LGBT+ community that their love is unbreakable and equal,” she says. “This commitment to equality is grounded in our company’s unshakeable belief that everyone deserves full and equal civil rights.”
Her commitment to full and equal rights for LGBT+ continues today. “I’m really hoping that we will be able to achieve marriage equality in Poland by 2025,” she says.
Highlighting the power of purpose in Martyna’s efforts, the judges acknowledged how “her tireless fight for a more inclusive society has been an incredible inspiration”.

For a global employer, that’s a significant untapped talent pool. A diverse talent pool brings diversity of thought and new points of view, thus sparking innovation. This enables business to better serve the needs of consumers.
“Having a diverse and inclusive environment where every person can bring their full and authentic selves to work is something we want Unilever to be famous for,” says CEO Alan Jope.
Our aim is to be No.1 employer of choice for people with a disability and to have 5% of our workforce represented by employees with disabilities by 2025.
On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, here are four ways we’re working to make Unilever more inclusive of people with a disability.
I run campaigns for e-commerce and execute them via online platforms. There’s plenty of strategic thinking involved, and the results I get are not impacted by the fact that I create campaigns in my wheelchair. Amna Raheel, Unilever Ecommerce Content Specialist 
We’re creating a culture where everyone can thrive
We want to provide an inclusive, positive workplace culture that makes all employees feel valued and welcomed. To promote more understanding of disabilities we are sharing the success stories of employees who are currently in Unilever and doing fabulous work while living with a disability.
Amna Raheel is just one of our hero pioneers who has shared her story. Amna works in e-commerce, has muscular dystrophy and is a wheelchair user.
“My role is not affected by my disability,” says Amna. “The digital world has made everything accessible for people with physical immobility. I run campaigns for e-commerce and execute them via online platforms such as daraz.pk and hummart.com. There’s plenty of strategic thinking involved, and the results I get are not impacted by the fact that I create campaigns in my wheelchair.”
Alongside real-life case studies we are offering staff access to a full suite of learning pathways via our in-house training platform to help build knowledge and more inclusive behaviours.
We’re improving our physical and digital accessibility
We’re working to create good accessibility in our systems and our workplaces and now have global guidelines to ensure accessibility in IT, recruitment, communications and workplace design.
As an example, it is now possible to explore the software that is available to overcome certain common disabilities such as visual impairment and cognitive disorders and even request specialised software.
We also have a commitment to make all our sites accessible by 2025.
We’ve engaged expert help
Working with the Business Disability Forum, a disability inclusion expertise organisation, we are making sure that we are bringing the latest thinking and frameworks as we design and deploy our global disability inclusion programme.
We’ve launched Enable@Unilever to promote change
Enable@Unilever is a global employee support network for our colleagues with disabilities and allies. It offers mentoring and advice on how to overcome any physical or emotional barriers preventing people from reaching their full potential at Unilever.
text The Covid-19 pandemic has defined 2020 for millions of people. At Unilever it’s certainly had a significant impact on our business, our people and the international communities we reach. As the world changed, so did we.
Here are just some of the ways we took action, setting out to make a positive impact through the crisis.
Visit Unilever.com’s Covid Response hub to read the details behind these highlights, along with many more stories.
€100 million in product donations
Product donations were part of our efforts. In March, we pledged to donate €100 million worth of products to support vulnerable communities through the pandemic. Unilever CEO Alan Jope said at the time: “It’s going to take action from everyone in society to overcome this challenge, and we are ready to play our part and fight this together.”
To deliver on this commitment, Unilever teams worked closely with the World Economic Forum’s Covid Action Platform and a number of NGO partners, leveraging our scale and supply chain to ensure products reached people in need across the globe.
In mid-December, the final shipment of soap, disinfectant, sanitiser and food products was sent out.
Creative purpose-led campaigns
As well as donating a range of products, our brands also used creativity to reflect the challenges of the year. Memorable campaigns from our Beauty & Personal Care division included Dove’s ‘Courage is Beautiful’ film, a moving tribute to frontline health professionals, 2020’s undisputed heroes.
For Lifebuoy, promoting handwashing as a way to help prevent disease is nothing new. The brand marked the milestone of reaching 1 billion people with handwashing education programmes in 2019. During the pandemic, Lifebuoy shared this message even further, through simultaneous public service announcements across 17 key markets and by working with almost 200 international influencers who shared handwashing tips on a range of social media platforms, reaching millions of engaged followers.
In our Foods & Refreshment division, Knorr rapidly created Knorr@Home content for social media, offering people store-cupboard recipe ideas and tips to create easy restaurant-style meals at home during lockdown. Ben & Jerry’s committed €2 million to support small business franchises across the US and communities local to its headquarters in Vermont. And Hellmann’s launched its Stay-In(spired) campaign, sharing inspiration and hacks to help food go further and use up leftover ingredients in tasty lunches or dinners.
In our Home Care division, we launched disinfection solutions in more than 60 markets and our Domestos brand shared a global Public Service Announcement on safe disinfection in the home. The campaign included a new TV ad to increase awareness of the importance of targeted hygiene at home using bleach to disinfect surfaces regularly.
Partnerships for the new normal
As the national lockdown eased in the UK, we announced a partnership with Uber to provide hygiene kits for drivers. These include Cif Antibacterial Multi-Purpose Spray and Lifebuoy alcohol-based sanitiser gel to keep their vehicles sanitised between passenger pick-ups. This partnership has since reached more countries in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
In July, we launched a partnership with hospitality company OYO, providing hygiene kits for guests and hygiene education and products for staff at OYO properties in India. Selected OYO properties now provide products from our Lifebuoy, Domex (Domestos), Sunlight and Cif brands to both staff and guests, which can create a cleaner and more hygienic experience from check-in to check-out.
And when it became clear that good hand hygiene could help play a part in reducing the spread of infection, we moved quickly to meet the rapidly rising global demand for sanitiser.
In a matter of weeks, we adapted our production lines and partnered with several new factories, significantly scaling up production of sanitiser that met the World Health Organization’s recommended standards of a minimum of 60% ethanol content.
Breakthrough research and development
In November, we were pleased to announce encouraging news from Microbac Laboratories, an independent and internationally accredited testing facility working on behalf of Unilever Research Laboratories.
Test results found that rinsing with mouthwash containing CPC Technology for 30 seconds is effective in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, by 99.9%.
The virus that causes Covid-19 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, which has been detected before, during and after the acute phase of illness, as well as in asymptomatic cases.1 Therefore, reducing the viral load in the mouth could help to reduce transmission. The findings indicate that mouthwash could become an important addition to other protective measures like handwashing, physical distancing and mask wearing.

text About the author
Co-Founder of Project Everyone
"Businesses are crucial to achieving the Global Goals, so it gives me great joy to see companies partnering with activists and community organisers to support grassroots change. I really believe we need to see more of these types of partnerships as communities begin to recover from this pandemic and we re-imagine a better future together.
On a personal note, my father worked for Unilever all his life, so it has been a real delight watching them lead the way in redefining what it means to be a responsible, innovative, global business, and we are hugely grateful to be a part of that journey."
Five years ago, the UN laid out a compelling vision for the future. The Global Goals present a framework for a cleaner, fairer, more inclusive world for all.
With the outbreak of Covid-19, momentum towards this vision has slowed. Indeed, the knock-on effects of the pandemic have seen progress in certain areas stall altogether or even go into reverse.
Yet, the promise of the Global Goals for a brighter future still very much stands. And at Unilever, we remain more committed than ever to seeing it realised.
The Global Goals’ target date of 2030 is inching ever closer. With each passing day, the stakes – for both society and the planet – get higher.
Who can help us? Young people. More than half the global population is under 30. That’s an immense pool of creativity and imagination.
It’s not just that the world’s youth have more passion for change than anyone else. They could be said to have more of a motivation to see change happen. After all, actions taken today will shape the lives they live tomorrow.
Hacking for solutions
Enter the Youth Power Hacks. Held in six countries over three months, this global online initiative will see hundreds of young hackers use their ingenuity, on their terms, to create their own solutions.
Unilever is joining with two inspiring civil society organisations – Project Everyone and Restless Development – to make it happen. Linking all three of us is a shared desire for the solutions of participating hackers to deliver tangible impacts for their home communities.
2021: a year of action
The multi-country hackathon has the Global Goals as its compass and youth power as its driving force, says Inés Yábar, Restless Development’s Senior Global Campaigns Coordinator:
“We are looking forward to seeing passionate and innovative young people come together to collaborate and find solutions to the toughest problems in their country. 2020 was a year for solidarity, 2021 is the year of action and we're ready to make that happen through these hacks.”
Get involved?
The Youth Power Hacks will be run across Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, from February to April 2021.
What’s a hack? A ‘hack’ is a fast-paced and fun approach to come up with new ideas and solutions to often difficult challenges. It brings together people from different backgrounds and experiences to tackle a problem and work together, at speed, to design new ideas. From health and climate through to education and equality, we guarantee the topics will be as broad as they are challenging.

How to apply to the Youth Power Hacks
If you’re 18–30 years old and want to make a difference in your local community and beyond, you can apply to join the Youth Power Hacks from 15 December 2020.
The six separate hackathons are scheduled for the following dates:
Kenya – 5 February 2021
South Africa – 19 February 2021
Nigeria – 5 March 2021
Indonesia – 19 March 2021
India – 9 April 2021
The Philippines – 23 April 2021
For those who do not live in one of our six designated countries, you’re still welcome to apply to the hack closest to your home, as a small number of people from other locations may still be selected to take part. We also host a wide range of actions to take part in on our Take Action hub.
text As news breaks of a potentially effective vaccine against Covid-19, new preliminary test results provide further encouraging progress in the search for possible additional measures to help prevent the spread of coronavirus3.
Microbac Laboratories, an independent and internationally accredited testing facility working on behalf of Unilever Research Laboratories, has found that rinsing with mouthwash containing CPC Technology for 30 seconds is effective in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, by 99.9%2.
CPC Technology is already widely used by the dental industry and is known for its antibacterial and anti-virus benefits. The preliminary lab test results show that, in addition to helping to prevent many oral diseases and problems, it could have an important role as an additional preventative measure to reduce the transmission of coronavirus3, when used as directed on the pack.
Eminent scientists have reviewed the Unilever research data and agree that it is in the public interest to share the results widely.
Building on existing research
The preliminary lab test results on SARS-CoV-2 build on existing Unilever research published on the biology research platform BioRxiv and follow ongoing discussions in the global medical and scientific community around the potential use of mouthwash as an additional measure to reduce the transmission of the virus.
Research continues, including into the duration of the effect, but a previous study4 on a small group of patients infected with Covid-19 suggest that viral load – the amount of virus particles a person is carrying – may be reduced in the mouth for up to six hours by using mouthwashes containing CPC Technology.
These preliminary test results showing the efficacy of CPC Technology against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are the latest in a large range of studies that are evaluating the efficacy of mouthwash technology against a number of viruses. In the tests we have done, only CPC Technology has to date shown consistently positive results.
“While research has previously been published into the effect of mouthwashes against surrogate coronaviruses, this is the first study in a laboratory to demonstrate that mouthwashes containing CPC can be effective against the actual virus responsible for Covid-19, and that they do indeed lower the viral load in recognised tests of mouthwash use,” says Dr Angela Rasmussen, Associate Research Scientist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the US.
Dr Rasmussen adds: “Other research on the duration of effect of CPC in a mouthwash on bacteria and coronavirus would suggest that the reduction in infectious viral load is likely to be sustained over time. This effect has also been demonstrated on a small sample of Covid-19 patients.”
An additional preventative measure
The virus that causes Covid-19 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, which has been detected before, during and after the acute phase of illness, as well as in asymptomatic cases5. Therefore, reducing the viral load in the mouth could help to reduce transmission. The findings indicate that mouthwash could become an important addition to other protective measures like handwashing, physical distancing and mask wearing.
“Given its long history of safe use, and wide availability across the world, using a mouthwash that contains CPC Technology could offer a simple, effective and safe step for people to take alongside existing Covid-19 protection and prevention measures as recommended by their health authorities,” says Professor Iain Chapple, Head of Research at the Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK.
He adds: “The results are promising and warrant further exploration with in vitro and human clinical studies. These are important to understand the substantivity of the anti-viral effect, in other words how long it lasts for in vivo. People should also continue to take all other existing precautions against the spread of the virus, including physical distancing, hand and surface hygiene, and face coverings.”
Sharing results and raising awareness
While mouthwash containing CPC Technology is not a cure or a proven way to prevent the transmission of coronavirus, the results are promising, and something which the Unilever Oral Care team wanted to share, given the critical stage of the pandemic.
“The results of the study are a promising step on our journey to understanding how mouthwashes could help reduce the spread of coronavirus alongside other preventative measures. Although our research is ongoing, we are sharing the results now so people can consider introducing a CPC-based mouthwash into their daily routine,” confirms Dr Glyn Roberts, Head of Unilever Oral Care R&D.
He adds: “Mouthwash products from other companies containing CPC could also have a positive effect, and we are sharing the findings in the spirit of openness and collaboration. We encourage others to continue research into the role that oral care products may have as an additional preventative measure during the pandemic. We are committed to making CPC-based products available in as many countries as possible in the coming months6.”

text We’re teaming up with Google Cloud to capture satellite images of the forests, biodiversity and water cycles that intersect our supply chain.
It’s a partnership that will help raise sustainability standards, allowing us to see a more complete picture – quite literally – of the ecosystems connected to the raw materials we source from around the world.
Using data to detect deforestation
By combining the power of cloud computing with Google Earth’s ability to map the planet by satellite imagery, we’ll be able to store and make sense of huge amounts of complex data, and gain insights into any impact on local environments and communities. And we’ll work with a broad range of technology partners to build a centralised command centre for this work.
Not only will this lead to greater accountability in our supply chain, it will also help us to better detect deforestation and prioritise any areas of forests or habitats in need of urgent protection.
It brings us a step closer to our goals of regenerating nature and ending deforestation in our supply chain by 2023. And it means we can work with suppliers to increase transparency and take action wherever and whenever it’s needed.
The partnership will initially focus on the sourcing of sustainable palm oil and will be extended to further commodities in the future.
Change through collaboration
While several academic and public organisations already use Google Earth imagery, this is the first time it’s been applied commercially for commodity sourcing. We hope to share our findings with further partners on the platform in the future, democratising data to put an end to deforestation.
“This collaboration with Google Cloud will take us to the next level in sustainable sourcing,” says Dave Ingram, Unilever’s Chief Procurement Officer.
“We will now be able to process and combine complex sets of data like never before. The combination of these sustainability insights with our commercial sourcing information is a significant step-change in transparency, which is crucial to better protect and regenerate nature.”
“At Google, we strive to build sustainability into everything that we do. Unilever has been an industry leader in environmental sustainability for many years, and we’re excited to be on this journey with them,” adds Rob Enslin, President, Google Cloud.
“Together, we’re demonstrating how technology can be a powerful tool in aiding businesses who strive to protect the Earth’s resources. It will require collective action to drive meaningful change, and we are committed to doing our part.”
text We have recently signed up to the first Sustainable Coconut Charter, an industry initiative to improve smallholder farmer incomes and livelihoods, enhance supply chain traceability, prevent deforestation and mitigate the climate crisis.
The charter will bring together industry leaders to develop programmes that address the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of smallholder farmers. The aim is to empower people directly involved and impacted by coconut farming, so they can play a positive role in the sustainable development of their region.
With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Green Invest Asia and private sector leaders, the charter is a pre-competitive industry collaboration that defines sustainability and outlines focus areas and principles, as well as programme goals and outcomes.
Such programmes are essential to ensure that smallholder farmer incomes and subsequently their livelihoods are improved – through better access to market, finance and technology, as well as increased capacity and productivity – in a way that protects and regenerates the environment.
It also responds to a desire within the industry – and among consumers – for traceability and transparency. In other words, knowing exactly where the product originates from.
As Martin Huxtable, our Director of Sustainable Sourcing, says: “With the demand for coconut-based ingredients increasing, it’s imperative the industry finds ways to meet that demand sustainably. The creation of the Coconut Charter is a timely and important step in the right direction.”
A multi-faceted and co-ordinated approach
Coconut is a highly versatile fruit and its derivatives – especially coconut oil – are sought-after ingredients for food, drink and personal care products.
But while sustainable practices are being adopted in parts of the industry, it’s early stages and they are largely fragmented. Until now, there have been no consistent guidelines to shape and ensure sustainability across global coconut supply chains.
For instance, the output of many plantations is under threat because of ageing trees. Unless these are replaced with new, healthy seedlings and modern planting methods are used more widely, it is estimated that tree productivity in Asia – where most coconuts are grown – will decline by more than 80% by 2027.
What’s more, smallholders, who grow around 95% of the total global harvest, often lack market, finance and technical know-how. The charter aims to improve access to this kind of information and support. This, in turn, will allow them to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices and replace ageing – less productive – plantations.
A more sustainable future for the coconut industry is critical for the millions of people who rely on it for their livelihoods and for the health of our planet. Martin Huxtable, Unilever’s Director of Sustainable Sourcing 
Building on our existing sustainability initiatives
Signing up to this charter will complement our existing coconut sustainability efforts. These include a tree rejuvenation initiative in Indonesia, a programme that trains farmers on good agriculture practices and a pilot project on climate change resilient agriculture. Through our Bango soy sauce brand, we also run a youth farmer programme to support the next generation of smallholders.
“Unilever is committed to a more sustainable future for the coconut industry,” says Martin. “It’s critical for our business. But more importantly, for the millions of people who rely on it for their livelihoods and for the health of our planet.”

text It is with transparency in mind that we share how we are progressing with our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), the foundation on which we create trust across every aspect of our value chain.
The latest report shows we are on track to achieve around 80% of our targets and is more transparent than ever on where the main challenges lie. It also outlines where we can share our experiences to support and improve the sustainable business journeys of others.
Consumers want sustainable brands
There is strong evidence that consumer demand for sustainable brands is growing. Our own research shows that 54% of consumers want to buy sustainably and one-third of them are already doing so. This is a big opportunity, and we want to ensure that our brands are at the forefront of it.
One way we have been doing this over recent years is through our sustainable living brands. These combine a strong social or environmental purpose, with products that contribute to achieving the USLP goals. We now have 26 sustainable living brands, up from our 2016 figure of 18, spanning all our Divisions. New entrants for this year are Vaseline, Sunlight, Sunsilk and Wall’s.
In 2017, they grew 46% faster than the rest of the business and delivered 70% of our turnover growth. Over the last four years, they have continuously outperformed our average rate of growth.
New businesses, brands and innovations
We’re also shaping and building our portfolio through new businesses joining Unilever, which are aligned with our sustainable living values. Just some of our new brands from the last 12 months or so which fit this profile include Pukka tea, Seventh Generation, Mãe Terra and Sundial.
And we’re not just acquiring, but growing our own as well, creating new brands with sustainability designed in at the core. For example, the vegan-friendly Love Beauty Planet personal care range which uses natural ingredients and recycled packaging, and the Red Red gluten-free and vegan snack pots which were launched in the UK earlier this year.
Plus of course, we’re bringing our core brands to more people every day, including much-loved favourites and new innovations. For example, in the last year, Domestos has launched a number of innovations to tackle sanitation and water scarcity issues including a new, affordable toilet cleaning powder format in India and its ‘Flush Less’ spray in South Africa.
601m people had been reached through our programmes on handwashing, sanitation, oral health, self-esteem and safe drinking water, by the end of 2017.
109of our manufacturing sites across 36 countries were using 100% renewable grid electricity, accounting for 65% of total grid electricity consumption, by the end of 2017.
56% of our agricultural raw materials were sustainably sourced, by the end of 2017.
Our USLP progress in 2017
The good news is that after seven years of progress we have already achieved, or are on track to deliver, around 80% of our targets.
Improving the health and wellbeing of more than 1 billion people by 2020
We are on track to meet our ambitious target to double the proportion of our portfolio that meets the highest nutrition standards by 2020. So far, 39% by volume already meets these standards. We are reformulating in all our product categories and have made significant progress on reducing salt, saturated fat, calories and sugar. For example, 70% of markets where we sell regular ice creams now have mini versions. In 2017, we launched Mini Magnums in India and Mini Cornettos in Brazil.
In terms of health and hygiene, we had reached more than 600 million people through our programmes on handwashing, sanitation, oral health, self-esteem and safe drinking water by the end of 2017. One brand that has made a remarkable impact is Dove, with its focus on better body confidence. We have reached 29 million young people already and are on track for 40 million by 2020.
Halving the environmental footprint of our products
When it comes to our own footprint, we have made good progress in almost all areas. For example, since 2008, we have cut CO₂ from energy in our manufacturing by 47%, reduced water use by 39% and the total waste sent for disposal has reached 98%. We have also made strides in our extended supply chain. For instance, by the end of 2017, 56% of our agricultural raw materials were sustainably sourced.
Reducing the environmental impact of how consumers use our products continues to be a challenge. For example, we have only managed to reduce water use by 2% since 2010. But it’s not all bad news. We are seeing encouraging progress on packaging waste, where we have made a new commitment to ensure that our plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.
Enhancing the livelihoods of millions of people by 2020
In 2017 we relaunched our Responsible Sourcing Policy, to strengthen our approach and to drive an increase in the number of suppliers committing to the programme. Around 55% of procurement spend was through suppliers who met mandatory requirements of the Policy. Our ambition is 100% by 2020.
We believe that women's empowerment is the single greatest enabler of human development and economic growth. We are building a gender-balanced organisation: by the end of 2017, 47% of total management were women, up from 46% in 2016. Our Shakti programme is providing work for over 70,000 women in low-income rural communities. In 2017, we also enabled 1.2 million women to access initiatives aiming to promote their safety, develop their skills and expand their opportunities.
And in terms of creating a more inclusive business, in 2017 we enabled around 716,000 smallholder farmers to access initiatives aimed at improving their agricultural practices or increasing their incomes. We also supported 1.6 million small-scale retailers to improve their income.

Where next?
A lot has changed in the world since we launched the USLP in 2010. As we started to think about its evolution, we wanted to get the opinions of employees and external stakeholders on what we are doing and where we should go from here. So, we embarked on the biggest listening exercise we have ever conducted on the future of sustainable business in Unilever.
As well as interviewing experts from across our value chain – including investors, suppliers, customers, creative agencies, other businesses, thought leaders, NGOs and academics – we also asked employees around the world to complete a survey to identify the issues that matter most to them.
The responses showed that the USLP has become a great source of pride and motivation within the business, and the key reason why many employees joined the company. At the same time, we were humbled to hear that the USLP is held in high esteem externally.
But not surprisingly, with this positivity comes a high level of expectation. As one external interviewee said: “Unilever is in an uncomfortable position. Expectations will be higher than ever. It raises the bar for everybody inside Unilever trying to work out what needs to happen next.”
The aim of this project was to gain a deep understanding of how to evolve the USLP for the future based on the views of our own people as well as independent experts in the field of sustainable business. We will now take all this rich feedback and work through the next stages of the process. We’ll regularly post updates on our progress, so please pop back soon to see how we’re doing.

text Movement has the power to transform lives. It helps us break limits we put on ourselves and those put on us by others. Movement brings people together, unites communities and stimulates positive social change. That’s why everyone should be able to experience the associated physical, mental and social benefits.
But sadly, for many people, those transformative effects remain out of reach.
Research from Rexona has found that 77% of people recognise movement as being important and yet, according to the World Health Organization, 80% of young people don’t move enough.
This is something that Rexona – or Degree, Sure or Shield, depending on where you are in the world – is fighting to change through its Breaking Limits Programme.
Launched on International Day of Sport for Development and Peace – a day that celebrates the power of sport to drive social change and community development – the programme aims to use sport and physical activity to give young people the confidence to overcome barriers and achieve more with their lives.
Too many people face too many barriers
While some of the barriers people face to moving or exercising are visible, like lack of access to facilities, many are unseen. And these are often formed from self-limiting beliefs.
Research conducted by Rexona found that about half of people worry about not being good enough, four in ten fear being judged, and almost half say they feel self-conscious when doing physical activity, especially when trying something new.
The research also found that close to two out of three people struggle with motivation. Another consistent reason, especially among young people, is a lack of confidence in their ability to achieve goals.
Society further fuels this fear. People face discrimination because of their race, gender or perceived ability. Our research found that seven out of ten people are made to feel they were not capable of doing something by someone else, and that 66% of people globally believe society only celebrates winners.
We needed to act to ensure that everyone – regardless of race, gender or perceived ability – truly has the right they deserve to be physically active. Kathryn Swallow, Global Brand Vice President of Rexona 
Empowering and inspiring
Rexona’s Breaking Limits Programme has been created in partnership with Beyond Sport, a global leader in driving sustainable social change through sport, and a network of organisations that use sport for social development.
The programme focuses on supporting youth, particularly those who face the biggest barriers to being active, equipping them with critical life skills such as confidence, teamwork and resilience. By providing them with access to coaches and mentors, along with safe spaces to move, these young people will be able to find the confidence to break limits – those set by themselves and society.
It achieves this by providing access to sports-based programmes, as well as equipping coaches and community leaders with the skills to fuel long-term behaviour change that will ultimately help transform the lives of the young people they reach.
The programme partners with non-profit organisations – that use movement to achieve positive outcomes – to enhance their initiatives and expand their reach.
“We’re committed to using our scale to do more good,” says Kathryn Swallow, Global Brand Vice President of Rexona. “As a brand that’s fighting for a world where everyone has the confidence to move more, we needed to act to ensure that everyone – regardless of race, gender or perceived ability – truly has the right they deserve to be physically active.”
Rexona is initially launching the programme in the US, Brazil and the UK, with the aim of rolling it out to other countries next year.

text We are delighted to announce that we are now using 100% renewable grid electricity across all our factories, offices, R&D facilities, data centres, warehouses and distribution centres.
As far as possible, our transition to renewable electricity has been delivered through supporting the development of local renewable energy markets. This ensures there is plenty of renewable electricity for us and others to use.
We also generate our own power with on-site solar installations at Unilever facilities in 23 countries.
According to Anuvrat Joshi, Business Development Director at Cleantech Solar, one of our supplier partners in India: “Through our partnership with Unilever, we will potentially be generating about three million units of energy every year. That’s the equivalent of planting nearly five thousand trees.”
Now that we have achieved 100% renewable electricity, we’re working to get our entire energy use from renewable sources. We currently have 24 sites that are completely carbon neutral around the world. Our goal is to become entirely carbon neutral across the business before 2030.
text Six years after the historic COP21 in Paris, Glasgow has brought over 190 countries back around the table to agree in specific terms the actions they must now take to get on track to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.
Growing ambition
While collective national climate plans still regrettably suggest a pathway of over 2 degrees of warming, this number is falling year on year (from over 4 degrees in 2015 before the Paris Agreement was signed) and we believe it will fall further.
A new commitment by countries to update their 2030 emission reduction plans next year will build on this sense of momentum.
The Glasgow Climate Pact has also called out, for the first time ever, the role of coal use and fossil fuel subsidies in driving the climate crisis. Countries have agreed to put the brakes on both – something Unilever has advocated for many years.
The role of nature-based solutions
High-level events around the summit itself recognised the importance of nature in tackling climate change.
The governments of the UK and Indonesia launched the FACT dialogue (Forests, Agriculture, Commodities and Trade) to improve communication and cooperation between governments on tackling the impact of commodity supply chains.
The LEAF Coalition, of which Unilever is a member, also announced a $1 billion pledge to protect the world’s forests from deforestation, a key source of greenhouse gas emissions.
Financing action and adaptation
We share the frustrations of developing countries who want and need developed countries to come good on their promises to provide $100 billion annually from 2020 – this hasn’t yet happened. Many of these countries have done little to cause the climate crisis and yet are already bearing the brunt of its impacts.
But Glasgow has provided a pathway to see that this pledge is met in the coming years, and with a greater focus on adaptation and resilience than at previous COPs.
The presentation of climate change as a social issue not only an environmental one was a key take out from COP26. Thanks to youth groups, indigenous peoples and local communities’ participation at the conference, the voices of future generations and those often bypassed in the formal negotiations, were louder than ever.
The arguments for climate justice are slowly making it from the side rooms to the main stage, and not before time.
Carbon markets
Carbon markets have been a controversial topic, with many stakeholders concerned that they will distract business from the core task of decarbonising their value chains, instead focussing on offsetting.
Others have worried that where land-based credits are involved, carbon markets can pose a risk to indigenous peoples and local communities through ‘land grabs’ as developers rush to implement projects.
Unilever hosted an event with the UK Presidency making the case for the highest social and environmental integrity in carbon markets. In the end, the carbon market negotiations closed with a deal that takes many of the issues into account, and it’s good to have clarity on the way forward.
We would have liked them to have gone further, but it is clear these rules will provide a floor not a ceiling.
We therefore welcome the announcement that the San Jose Principles Coalition will work to go beyond the deal made in Glasgow to operationalise the Principles which have social and environmental integrity at their core, and to bring other countries on board.

Leadership of businesses and subnational governments
Outside of the formal COP perhaps the real success was the acceleration in commitments to real and tangible actions across businesses, cities, states and regions.
There was a greater private sector presence than at previous COPs and more collaboration between national governments and non-state actors. It gave COP attendees and watchers the sense that momentum is firmly with the low carbon transition and will only grow in size and pace.
The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was one of the most striking announcements with financial organisations with $130+ trillion of assets committing to align their investment strategies with net zero.
For our part, Unilever underlined the role of nature, people and technology in finding solutions to the climate crisis and shared our new Forest Data Partnership with Google Cloud, NASA, WRI, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, announced by USAID.
Our brands Hellmann’s, The Vegetarian Butcher and Knorr also partnered with the UK government to help raise public awareness of the impacts of our diets and encourage everyone to make changes in their everyday lives.
Where do we go from here?
COPs are unique because they represent a consensus view – neither the most nor the least ambitious. It is easy to look at the gap between where the world is and where it needs to be and take a pessimistic view on COP26.
But it’s also possible to see how far we’ve all come and recognise that we have indeed reached a tipping point in our collective response to climate change.
One thing is certain: Unilever is more committed than ever to tackling the climate crisis. We’re listening to the expectations of young people – whose future hangs in the balance. We’re eliminating emissions from our operations by 2030, and working with our brands, suppliers, partners and consumers to reach net zero across our value chain by 2039.
More and more companies are joining us, and we will keep using our voice to encourage ambitious climate action right across the private sector. We will leverage this to call on governments to accelerate wider system changes that will help all of us to move faster towards 1.5°C.
The actions we take over the next few years will make or break our climate, with profound consequences for people and nature. We’re all in this together – and we need to get on with it.

A new initiative aims to inspire sustainable ad production across the industry
With an investment of €1 billion over the next ten years, we’re replacing ingredients derived from fossil fuels in our cleaning and laundry product formulations with ingredients from renewable or recycled sources by 2030.
text Ever struggled to get that last drop out of your shampoo bottle? Frowned at the remnants of a laundry tablet still clinging to your washing machine drawer? Or discovered an ice cream that you can’t get enough of, and wish you could try it in a smorgasbord of flavours? We hear you. And we’re working on it.
We want to know what you think of our products – the good and the bad. What you struggle with, what you’re hooked on, how you’d like things to change, and where we can make a difference for you.
That’s why we have launched a concept called the Digital Voice of the Consumer. It means that we’re constantly reviewing the feedback people kindly provide on our brands – through our consumer engagement centres, product ratings and reviews on social media, for example. And then we act fast.
We’re taking your feedback and making sure it reaches the right people, so we can rapidly respond to any issue you have with our products. It means if there’s a problem with product quality across any of our brands, we can move quickly to put it right.
“I strongly believe that creating a positive experience for consumers every time they interact with our products is a key element to drive business growth,” says Unilever’s Chief Quality Officer Sabina Krzystolik.
“Digital Voice of the Consumer is an opportunity to have instantaneous, real-time consumer feedback available to everyone across the business – from the people who make strategic long-term business decisions to the people who design and make our products.”
How we’re taking action
This year, Digital Voice of the Consumer data helped us discover and shut down online retailers who were selling poor-quality counterfeit imitations of Unilever products in India and Indonesia. Not only does this sort of activity put the reputation of our brands at risk, it also potentially puts consumers in harm’s way as the formulas in counterfeit bottles may look and feel just like the real thing, but they haven’t been through tests for product quality and safety.
Sometimes consumer feedback helps us figure out what products to put on the shelf. Earlier this year Rexona Clinical Aerosol launched in Brazil. Consumers contacted Rexona to say they loved the product, but they wished a fragrance-free version was available. We made their ideas a reality and within weeks we launched a fragrance-free alternative.
In South Africa, we discontinued our Robertsons Pickling Spice condiment at the end of 2016. Hundreds of consumers then tried to track the product down – it seems we had underestimated how popular it really was. This year we’ve brought it back, delighting consumers.
Let’s stay connected
If there’s something you’ve noticed about a Unilever product that you love, hate, or think we could tweak for the better, let us know. Whether your feedback is a post on social media, a comment on a website or a call to a careline – we will work on it.
text Every year, we recognise pioneering individuals within the company who have brought our values to life and truly embody what it means to be part of Unilever. Our 2019 Heroes with Impact have gone above and beyond their day-to-day jobs. Their stories paint a picture of passion, purpose and drive.
Palu is a small city on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, home to a population of over 300,000 and popular with tourists for its white sandy beaches.
On 28 September 2018, the city was hit by a powerful earthquake which had its epicentre 80km to the north. Winarto-Anggun Wicaksono, who was at the time Area Sales Manager in our Palu office, remembers the day. “It was very, very scary,” he says. “The floor was shaking, not only up and down but left and right. I ran as fast as I could to get outside the building. People were screaming, ‘tsunami, tsunami’.”
They were right. A tsunami up to 3 metres high swept through Palu, knocking down buildings and damaging mosques. Despite the danger, Winarto headed for the waterfront where his family lived but could not locate them.
Despite being unsure whether his family had reached safety, Winarto made his way back to the Unilever depot and started to organise a relief team to help residents. “With the team, I put on a strong face – I wanted to give them hope,” he says. “But inside, in my heart, I could have cried.”
Ensuring the safe evacuation of all Unilever families
One of his first actions was to help set up a relief camp amid the chaos. Electricity and the internet were cut off, food and clean water were scarce, and key infrastructure had been destroyed. Nonetheless, Winarto managed to liaise with Unilever’s crisis management team in Jakarta and led efforts to execute the emergency plan.
He began tracking down the families of local Unilever employees. Within 72 hours, under Winarto’s leadership, all Unilever team members and their families, as well as those of our business partners – a total of 81 people – had been safely evacuated to Makassar, some 500km to the south.
While others were flown to safety, Winarto refused to leave with the earlier evacuations and determined to stay until he was no longer needed.
But good news followed: his own family were safe and among the first wave to be taken to Makassar.
Reflecting on this natural disaster which claimed over 2,000 lives, Winarto admits, “we are very lucky – we are still alive”. The judges highlighted his selflessness and leadership during the emergency and praised this “incredible act of heroism”.
text We are committed to ending deforestation across our supply chain – particularly in the cultivation of crops like palm oil and soy. We were the first consumer goods company to publish a full list of the palm oil suppliers and third-party mills in our supply chain. And we are the only one to publish a public grievance report so that issues associated with our direct and indirect palm oil suppliers can be identified and acted on.
We did this because we believe that transparency leads to transformation.
At the same time, using satellite technology (such as through our partnership with World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch) and by working with Aidenvironment (transitioning to Earth Equalizer) to evolve its oil palm concession mapping platform, we’ve been advancing the ways in which we monitor the raw materials used to make our products.
We continue our partnership and support with the World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch by being part of a consortium of companies to develop radar monitoring technology to detect deforestation in near real-time and with greater accuracy.
Reimagining our approach to traceability
However, the supply chains for all agricultural commodities traded on a global scale have many layers to them. To overcome the challenges associated with any supply chain, you need sight of every part of it. And the first mile – the bit from an individual farm or plantation to a mill – presents a particularly unique challenge for sustainable sourcing.
Before being processed, crops such as palm oil fruit or soy can be harvested from many different areas of land, belonging to numerous farmers, and mixed with raw material from other farms several times over before even reaching the mill.
To ensure that the land used to grow crops such as palm oil fruit and soy isn’t connected to deforestation, we’re reimagining our approach to traceability so we can do even more to protect forests.
A clearer picture of where our crops come from
We’re launching a pilot with Orbital Insight, a US tech company that specialises in geospatial analytics. The pilot uses geolocation data to help identify the individual farms and plantations that are most likely to be supplying the palm oil mills in our extended supply chain.
The technology leverages GPS data – aggregated and anonymised – to allow Orbital Insight to spot traffic patterns. Where there is a consistent flow of traffic between an area of land and a mill, it suggests a potential link.
This means we can get a much clearer picture of where harvested crops are coming from, even down to the individual field. This, in turn, allows us to predict the possibility of issues such as deforestation and, where found, to take action.
Enhancing our existing satellite monitoring capability
The pilot is another step towards building a digital ecosystem with a number of technology partners, which helps us to monitor our supply chain even more closely.
Satellite technology already plays an important role in monitoring land-use change. But images alone can’t prevent deforestation.
We need to be able to identify links between the mills and the farms or plantations that supply them in order to get real ‘ground truth’.
The current technique is to look at a satellite image and draw a 50km radius around the mills. We then assume that the farms or plantations in those catchment areas are equally likely to be supplying the mills. While this methodology has been used and accepted by much of the industry over past years, we believe that it needs to be improved on.
Traceability analysis of the palm oil supply chain in Sumatra 
By combining tens of thousands of satellite images with geolocation data and applying artificial intelligence and scalable data science, this new system will give us unique insights by showing the predicted likelihood that a farm or plantation is supplying any given mill.
It’s a step change from the current approach and it can model supply chain linkages at scale. We’re now working with Orbital Insight to develop and finesse this into an operational methodology, and testing the technology at a small number of palm oil mills in Indonesia and soy mills in Brazil.
This approach brings a new level of sophistication to traceability – one that has the potential to work on a massive scale, for Unilever and the rest of the industry.
“Better monitoring helps all of us to understand what’s happening within our supply chains,” says Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer. “By companies coming together and using cutting-edge technology to carefully monitor our forests, we can all get closer to achieving our collective goal of ending deforestation.”
text The scale of the challenge
According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), just 14% of the plastic packaging used globally makes its way to recycling plants, while 40% ends up in landfill and a third in fragile ecosystems. By 2050, it is estimated there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans.
Treating plastic packaging as a valuable resource to be managed efficiently and effectively is key to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Sustainable Consumption & Production) and, in doing so, shifting away from a ‘take-make-dispose’ model of consumption to one which is fully circular.
Tackling the issue on a number of fronts
To help transform global plastic packaging material flows, we have made a commitment to ensure that all of our plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.
We will also renew our membership of EMF for another three years and endorse and support their New Plastics Economy initiative. And as part of this, we will publish the full ‘palette’ of plastics materials used in our packaging by 2020 to help create a plastics protocol for the industry.
Unilever has already committed to reduce the weight of the packaging we use by one third by 2020, and increase our use of recycled plastic content in packaging to at least 25% by 2025.
As part of this new commitment, Unilever will ensure that by 2025, it is technically possible for our plastic packaging to be reused or recycled and that there are established, proven examples of it being commercially viable for plastics reprocessors to recycle the material.
We need to do more as an industry
“Our plastic packaging plays a critical role in making our products appealing, safe and enjoyable for our consumers,” says Unilever CEO, Paul Polman. “Yet it is clear that if we want to continue to reap the benefits of this versatile material, we need to do much more as an industry to help ensure it is managed responsibly and efficiently post-consumer use.
“To address the challenge of ocean plastic waste we need to work on systemic solutions – ones that stop plastics entering our waterways in the first place. We hope these commitments will encourage others in the industry to make collective progress towards ensuring that all of our plastic packaging is fully recyclable and recycled.
“We also need to work in partnership with governments and other stakeholders to support the development and scaling up of collection and reprocessing infrastructure which is so critical in the transition towards a circular economy. Ultimately, we want all of the industry’s plastic packaging to be fully circular,” he says.
Ellen MacArthur says: "By committing to ambitious circular economy goals for plastic packaging, Unilever is contributing to tangible system change and sends a strong signal to the entire fast-moving consumer goods industry. Combining upstream measures on design and materials with post-use strategies demonstrates the system-wide approach that is required to turn the New Plastics Economy into reality."
Architect and circular economy leader, William McDonough, adds: “The optimisation of packaging and plastics is so timely and important that all the people, communities and companies involved – suppliers, producers, retailers, customers and consumers – can work together now, with common values and purpose, to create and share beneficial value for generations to come.”
text The restroom, WC, jakes, bog, dunny, loo or john. Those of us who have access to clean safe sanitation rarely give the toilet (or whatever name we choose to call this everyday convenience) a second thought. But for two in every three people around the world who don’t, it’s a pressing concern.
“Domestos is working to change that. We’ve worked with UNICEF and other partners since 2012 to support sanitation programmes that teach toilet-building skills, support women in promoting good hygiene practices and, crucially, improve access to toilets in schools,” says Madhusudhan Rao, Executive Vice President of Home and Hygiene.
Here’s how three people have used that empowerment to make a positive impact on their own and their community’s lives.
The community worker who built a toilet for her village
I’m glad my daughter will not have to face the same challenges as me and have to go outside to the toilet. Kolika, community worker 
Women and girls have a greater need for privacy when going to the toilet than men. If they don’t have access to a toilet, usually the only option is to defecate in the open, which can impact their health. To avoid the unwanted attention, they’ll avoid going during daylight, which can lead to concerns for their safety.
“We were often ashamed,” admits local community worker Kolika, whom we helped enlist stone masons to build a WC for her village. “You can never be sure of people’s intentions,” she explains.
Having a toilet of their own has offered the women peace of mind for themselves and the next generation. “I’m glad my daughter will not have to face the same challenges as me and have to go outside to the toilet,” Kolika says.
She has high hopes of her daughter becoming a nurse, and access to a village toilet may help her daughter’s chances. A UNICEF and WaterAid study says more than a third of girls in South Asia miss classes each month during their period. Offering teens the ability to manage their periods in private increases girls’ continued school attendance.
The boy who got his schooling back and teaches sanitation to others
1 in 4 school days are lost as a result of poor sanitation
It’s not just girl’s education that can be impacted. Health issues such as sickness and diarrhoea that result from poor sanitation can see children miss up to 20% of their schooling. Until recently 14-year-old Virendra (above centre) was one of them.
After seeing the difference a toilet made to his school and hearing from teachers about the importance of good hygiene habits to pupil health and wellbeing, Virendra and his sister began to lobby their parents for a toilet for the family. Now they don’t have to walk miles from home.
Virendra’s school attendance has by increased by 20% and he’s taken on the role of ‘deputy prime minister’ in his school’s cabinet where he champions the importance of sanitation. Peers “are involved in meetings so they understand the importance of sanitation and cleanliness,” he says.
The headmaster who has seen sanitation’s impact on pupil performance
Our teachers see a positive difference, with improved academic performance of the children Pankaj, Headmaster, Goth Mahudi primary school 
Pankaj is the headmaster of Goth Mahudi primary school in Rajasthan, India. “My vision is that all our children lead their lives in a better way, whatever that may be.”
Before the school had toilet facilities, attendance was low. “When the children relieved themselves in the open they would often get very sick and much of their time was spent in the hospital rather than at school learning,” he says.
With clean toilet facilities, attendance has risen and Pankaj and has noticed a difference in his pupils’ results. “Our teachers see a positive difference, with improved academic performance of the children,” he says.
Everyone should have a right to a clean toilet
“World Toilet Day is the one day when everyone wants to talk about toilets,” says Madhusudhan Rao. “So far, in partnership with UNICEF, we have helped over 16 million people gain access to sanitation and we will continue our work until everyone can take access to a clean safe toilet for granted,” he says.
text At the age of 18, Emmanuel Emodek was thrown out of the computer lab at school, when he complained about having to wait 45 minutes for a painfully slow internet connection to load. He decided that technology was a waste of time.
Now, 16 years later, he’s the managing director of a fast-growing Uganda-based social enterprise that’s helping thousands of customers improve their prospects through a digital app. And he’s the overall winner of the HRH The Prince of Wales Young Sustainability Entrepreneur Prize.
Emmanuel admits he’s the last person he would have expected to become a tech entrepreneur. But everything about his life story defies convention – and it’s encouraging proof that with ambition, passion and the right support, we all have the potential to make a positive impact on the world.
The power of potential
After graduating from high school, Emmanuel stayed true to his teenage promise of avoiding computers for a decade. Keen to help provide a steady income for his widowed mother and four siblings, with whom he had been recently reunited after growing up parentless, he turned down a place at university and set up his own business. It closed in under a year and Emmanuel found himself homeless. A second business followed, and for the second time, he found himself homeless when the idea failed to take off.
Emmanuel had lost everything. And without clear accounts and records, he struggled to understand why his businesses had failed to survive.
“I blamed it on the competition, the government, other people. I gave up. I was done,” he recalls.
But at his lowest ebb, Emmanuel met one of his former schoolteachers, and his life began to change. In the years since school, Monica Kiconco Asiimwe’s career had flourished. She had gone on to become a university lecturer, and then one of the top distributors of Unilever products nationwide.
“Monica saw something in me,” says Emmanuel. “She told me that she knew I could think up some kind of solution that would help small business owners stay afloat, and that she would work alongside me to do so. Neither of us had a clue about what we would create or how we would do it. But Monica encouraged me to imagine, and that’s how ChapChap was born.”
From imagination to application
Emmanuel’s epiphany came when he started working in a small business alongside one of his brothers, a trained book-keeper. Seeing first hand the value of accurate accounting to track performance, profits, stock and expenditure, he realised the difference real-time records could make to business owners. In fact, half the small businesses launched in Africa fail because of poor book-keeping, a lack of inventory management and bad business practices.
Despite his reservations about computers, Emmanuel agreed to meet James Alituhikya, a software engineer and former student of Monica’s. Sitting at a laptop, they discussed the potential of an app or program that could put accounting software in the palm of business owners’ hands, so that if they couldn’t afford a book-keeper, they could still monitor their finances confidently.
“James believed in the idea straight away,” says Emmanuel. “Monica and I had always said we felt technology was built for the elite – that it eliminated people at the bottom of the pyramid. So together the three of us set out to change the system.”
Since launch ChapChap has helped nearly 6,000 small businesses in Uganda and now aims to expand into Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Nigeria. 
A brighter future
The result is ChapChap – a digital platform that helps small businesses keep track of transactions, stock inventory, costs, sales and data from their smartphone, so they can fine-tune their practices and optimise profits. Since launch it has helped close to 6,000 businesses in Uganda to improve their performance management and increase their revenues. And ChapChap now aims to expand beyond Uganda into Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Nigeria.
In September 2019, Emmanuel was selected as one of eight winners of Unilever’s Young Entrepreneurs Award. As part of the prize, he joined the other winners to attend a residential accelerator programme run by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and will benefit from a year of mentoring support tailored to ChapChap’s specific needs. Now, as the overall winner, Emmanuel has won a €50,000 grant, which he plans to use to scale up ChapChap’s reach.
“Growing up without parents, and with little money, I think coming up with a practical solution to help people make more of their lives is something that was always in my DNA,” he says.
“I don’t want anyone to read my story and feel sorry for me. I want it to be a lesson to someone who is bringing up a child, to a teacher, or to a young person, that people have dreams. We can kill those dreams, or we can help bring them to life. I will always be grateful that someone helped me to fulfil my potential.”

text Protecting the world’s forests is an important solution to fighting climate change. Which is why, at Unilever, we’re committed to achieving a deforestation-free supply chain for palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by the end of 2023.
We have learnt we need to go beyond certification in order to verify that our supply chain – and in particular, the most important first mile – is deforestation-free.
Our plan to achieve this has three elements: building greater traceability and transparency of our supply chain; focusing our sourcing on suppliers who share our sustainability ambitions; and empowering the farmers and smallholders in the communities and landscapes we source from.
Our focus on these areas means we continue to build the skills, capabilities and networks to progress towards our goal and beyond.
Technology: the key to supply chain visibility
The visibility that technology gives us into our supply chains means we can make them increasingly more transparent and traceable. It allows us to better see and understand what’s happening to forests globally, including the critical ‘first mile’ from where raw material is grown to where it is first processed – as this is where the greatest risk of deforestation lies.
We’re collaborating with partners to trial and adopt state-of-the-art technology including satellite imaging, artificial intelligence and geolocation data.
By providing new insights and data, our ecosystem of tech solutions – which we’re piloting in our forest-risk supply chains​​​​ – allows us to predict where forests are at risk of deforestation, so we can take proactive and preventive measures to protect forests, ecosystems and livelihoods.
“The latest digital capabilities will help us better identify high-risk areas and target interventions where they’re most needed,” says Willem Uijen, our Chief Procurement Officer. “Technology will also be a force for good as we leverage these capabilities to help us understand areas that need protection and those that have high potential for regeneration.”

A range of groundbreaking solutions
67 millionhectares of forests mapped
We’re using anonymised data signals from mobile devices to spot traffic patterns between farms and mills. A consistent flow of traffic suggests a potential sourcing link and therefore a potential link to our extended supply chain. This insight helps us to understand who’s sourcing from whom.
We’re applying artificial intelligence to satellite imaging to detect changes in tree cover and provide deforestation alerts. This ‘eye in the sky’ solution – built for regions with a lot of cloud cover, like South East Asia – estimates the amount of carbon stored by forests and quantifies the associated climate threat when trees are felled.
77,000villages assessed to support sourcing from low-risk smallholders
We ran a crowdsourcing pilot in Aceh, Indonesia, to train contributors to take photos and videos of oil palm fruit collection points – where it is traded informally – and upload them to a digital platform. This gives us a more informed view of previously unseen parts of our supply chain.
We’re also exploring the use of blockchain to build a permanent digital record of a commodity’s journey through the value chain, compiling data about the mills, refineries and processors where it is handled. The idea is to make sustainability credentials traceable and immutable, even when the material is mixed with that from another source.
3,960palm estates analysed to direct suppliers to deforestation-free sources
Google Cloud, our ‘command centre’, gives us a full picture of what’s happening in our supply chain, especially in the first mile, combining almost 40 years of continuous satellite imagery with powerful data storage and machine learning to produce new insights. This means we can monitor the mills, landscapes and farms in certain geographical areas and estimate which farms/plantations are supplying those mills.
At COP26, together with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Resources Institute (WRI), NASA and Google, we announced the creation of the Forest Data Partnership. The aim is to create a common approach to collecting, analysing and storing data about sourcing areas and forests, making this information available to everyone to help drive collective action against deforestation. The key focus regions for this partnership include the Amazon Basin, South East Asia and West Africa.
Willem says: “We continue to test and scale technology solutions for greater traceability and transparency in our supply chain, so we can partner with suppliers, governments and NGOs, to help protect and regenerate nature for generations to come.”

text On 26 May, Gartner released its annual ranking of global supply chains, which identifies leaders across industries and spotlights those forging the way in creating digital and sustainable supply chains.
In this, the 18th edition of the research firm’s Supply Chain Top 25, we retained our spot in the exclusive ‘Masters’ category for the fourth consecutive year, alongside Amazon, Apple, P&G and McDonald’s.
The ranking looks at overall business and corporate responsibility metrics, how peers rate each other, and how Gartner analysts also view and rank these companies. The Masters category acknowledges sustained supply chain excellence. To be considered Masters, companies must have attained top-five composite scores for at least seven out of the past ten years. As such, it is a highly prestigious and much coveted recognition.
This year – according to the analysts who compile the list – our Masters status was secured by our continued transformation for a purpose-led supply chain that leverages agility and resilience for competitive differentiation, heavy investment in analytics to drive real-time decision making, and scouting sustainability opportunities through smaller, diverse, start-up suppliers and ecosystems with competitors.
The past few years have been incredibly difficult for supply chains all over the world, keeping factories running while countries are moving in and out of lockdown, as well as having to deal with high inflation and shipping congestion.
In a message to all employees, our Chief Supply Chain and Business Operations Officer, Reggie Ecclissato wrote: “We have achieved this recognition due to the dedication and passion of the many thousands of people who work across Unilever’s global supply chain. It is through your tireless efforts to keep people safe, to ensure that the communities we operate in continue to receive essential goods and services every day, everywhere, and to consistently push the boundaries in the sustainability and digital realms, to build a future-fit, purpose-driven supply chain that delivers today and transforms tomorrow.”
About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25
The Supply Chain Top 25 ranking comprises two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past. The opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score.

text A new beginning...
Our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) was a game-changer for us, and for others.
At a time when most businesses saw sustainability as an add-on to business, we saw that they were inextricably linked. Business success simply could not come at the expense of people and the planet.
So in 2010 we set out to grow our business while increasing our positive social impact and reducing our impact on the environment.
And we committed to driving that progress through far-reaching goals that aimed to change the lives of billions of people. We set more than 50 ambitious, time-bound targets – chosen because we saw them as critical to our business and the world, not because we knew if, or even how, we could achieve them.
We didn’t think that we had to have all the answers. If we knew all the answers, why hadn’t we already done it? It was very much a journey of ambition. Dr Henry King, Unilever Director of Sustainability Science and Technology 
... built on pioneering foundations
That pioneering spirit wasn’t new to us.
Our commitment to changing the world for the better has driven Unilever since William Lever created Sunlight Soap to make health and hygiene affordable to workers more than a century ago.
But the USLP took us further and faster than ever before.
Some goals we have met. Some we have missed. But even where we’ve fallen short, we are a better business for trying.
And having the targets in place was in itself an exercise in managing for sustainability. “You might not know how to get there, but knowing the targets really focuses your mind,” says Ilaria Ida, Unilever Senior Manager, Sustainable Sourcing. “I welcomed those targets and that pressure and that transparency, because it kept us accountable – we knew what our North Star should be.”
Watch the story of our ten-year journey.
Transforming lives. Transforming our business
The USLP wasn't ‘just’ a sustainability plan. It was a plan for a successful, sustainable business – one that was ready to transform itself. “For me, the USLP is a statement that business has to, and can, change its role in society,” says Thomas Lingard, Unilever’s Global Sustainability Director, Climate and Environment.
In creating the USLP, we looked at every aspect of our value chain, and we set out three big goals spanning our social, environmental and economic performance.
Changing business – and changing ourselves
Creating the plan was one thing. Putting it into action was another.
It meant building on successful programmes where they existed. It meant creating new ones entirely where they did not. And above all it meant adapting, year after year, programme by programme, function by function – and person by person.
Because while we had always been a business with purpose at our heart, the USLP was so pioneering that it took time for all of us to understand that we weren’t just changing our business, we were changing the way business was done.
Over the last ten years one of the most amazing things has been to watch how the people within the company have found their way into ownership of the USLP. Opening people’s eyes to the existence of sustainability, internally and externally, seems to me really important. Jonathon Porritt, environmentalist and member of the USLP Advisory Council 
Achievements to be proud of
Each year, we’ve reported our progress in our Sustainable Living Report, making sure we account for the targets we’re missing, as well as those we’ve met.
After ten years of the USLP, we can be proud of the positive impacts we’ve made to the lives of billions of people. Here are just a few:
We’ve reached 1.3 billion people through our health and hygiene programmes.
We’ve reduced the total waste footprint per consumer use of our products by 32% and achieved zero waste to landfill across all our factories.
We’ve reduced greenhouse gas emissions in our own manufacturing by 50% and reached 100% renewable grid electricity.
We’ve reduced sugar across all our sweetened tea-based beverages by 23%, and 56% of our foods portfolio now meets recognised High Nutrition Standards.
And as well as enabling 2.34 million women to access initiatives aiming to promote their safety, develop their skills or expand their opportunities, we’ve moved towards a gender-balanced workplace in which 51% of management roles are held by women.
Creating lasting benefits for our business
The USLP has improved our business in lasting ways.
It has helped us grow our brands and drive innovation. It has helped us to avoid over €1 billion in costs, by improving water and energy efficiency in our factories, and by using less material and producing less waste. Sustainable sourcing has helped secure our supplies, reducing risk and volatility in our raw material supply chain. And our approach has helped us attract, and retain, the best talent.
One of the USLP’s biggest achievements has been the way our multi-stakeholder model has changed the world around us.
Many of our targets could not be delivered by us acting alone. So we’ve worked with others, developing global partnerships that are driving transformational change in empowering women, protecting forests, improving health, sustainable farming and more.
“It was a really different way of doing business,” says Rebecca Marmot, Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer. “It meant not just thinking about consumers and shareholders, it also meant thinking about civil society, NGOs, the UN. We realised that if you orientate business in a different way you can play a massive part in bridging development gaps around the world – and that creates opportunities for business.”

Learning from what worked – and what didn’t
We failed to reach some of our targets – and when we analyse where we’ve fallen short, we can see key themes that we will build into our work in the future.
For example, we set out to source 100% of our agricultural raw materials sustainably – but we’ve found it difficult to deliver on targets when we don’t have full visibility of the supply chain.
We’ve also learnt that measuring the actual impact of our programmes is extremely difficult.
We need to be flexible. For example, we set out a waste target in 2010, but revised it in 2017 and again in 2019 to ensure we set ourselves even more ambitious targets, which will radically reshape our plastic use.
We need to be humble. When it came to reducing the greenhouse gas and water impacts of our products, we underestimated how challenging it is to help consumers to change their behaviours, and we misjudged how long it takes to do so.
And we need to advocate for more systems change. We’ve been part of helping to advocate for renewable energy since the start of the USLP, and we’ve come to realise that we have to play a role in advocating for change in other industries as well.
Following our Compass to a sustainable business
So, where do we go next?
Our answer is the new Unilever Compass.
The Compass sets out our vision to be the leader in sustainable business globally – and we mean sustainable in the broadest sense of the word: socially, environmentally and economically.
It is our new, fully integrated corporate strategy which builds on the successes and the lessons learnt over the last ten years of the USLP. It will have nine imperatives and 15 multi-year priorities that cover the full spectrum of our business and our wider ecosystem, with a range of ambitious targets that are more holistic, inclusive and far-reaching than ever before.
While the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan is drawing to a close, the journey towards achieving our purpose of making sustainable living commonplace for the world’s 8 billion people continues. We know we can lead the charge, but we need to be better, bolder and faster.

text Can business really change things for the better?
Do brands have the power to make a positive difference to people's lives?
We're convinced the answer to both questions is 'yes' – and as we celebrate our 90th birthday as Unilever, we believe the successes of our past will prove a vital foundation for creating a better world.
A brighter tomorrow, built on a better business
Today, in 2020, Unilever is driven by our ambition to be the world's most sustainable business.
In 190 countries around the world, our brands and operations support the big goals of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan: helping more than a billion people improve their health and well-being, halving the environmental impact of using our products, and enhancing the livelihoods of millions of people in our supply chain.
These goals are challenging, and we'll need a powerful sense of purpose to achieve them.
But purpose isn't new for us. It was there at our formation in 1930.
The truest and highest form of enlightened self-interest requires that we pay the fullest regard to the interest and welfare of those around us, whose wellbeing we must bind up with our own and with whom we must share our prosperity. William Hesketh Lever, co-founder, 1900 
Founded with a social mission. Driven by purpose.
When British soap-maker Lever Brothers and Dutch company Margarine Unie merged their operations to become Unilever, both companies brought a strong sense of social mission.
Lever Brothers, which was celebrated for providing better housing, education and working conditions for employees, created Sunlight Soap with an explicit purpose: ‘to make cleanliness commonplace’.
Margarine Unie, as well as providing accessible healthcare for workers, created brands which added variety to the diets of workers who at that time relied on dry bread.
We believe it is that sense of purpose that has driven our success since 1930 – and that will continue to inspire us for the next 90 years.
Brands without a purpose will have no long-term future with Unilever. Alan Jope, Unilever CEO, 2019 
Changing times. Constant ambition.
Making quality products affordable for working people. Supporting health, hygiene, and nutrition. Providing better conditions for employees. The ambitions which motivated our founding companies can still be seen in the way our brands are working to create positive change today.
Of course, times have changed since 1930. And there is still a huge amount of work we have to do as a business to ‘make sustainable living commonplace’.
But we think our founders would recognise and applaud the spirit behind our sustainability ambitions. And we're sure that they'd join us in celebrating the successes of our company and our brands.
They, like us, knew that companies with purpose last.
So to mark our birthday, we’re sharing some of our favourite stories from our nine decades of history.
Beginning with our people, who are at the heart of our success. Hear from some of them in our birthday film – including Elma Jones, who joined Unilever in 1934, Keerthana Kasi who joined in 1996, and Samantha Thian, who joined in 2018.
And here are just a few stories from some of our most famous brands that show that our founders were right: businesses that do good, do well.

text The world loves tea. It’s how 2 million people start their day. Its power to create connections puts it at the heart of cultural ceremonies, negotiating everything from business deals to banns of marriage. It’s also at the centre of everyday rituals like a 4 o’clock screen break and a catch-up with friends.
Tea’s ability to give people a reason to have a conversation lies at the heart of Lipton’s newly launched brand purpose to awaken the world to quality connections and fight against hidden loneliness.
And it’s this ‘hidden’ quality that is key, because the generation that research has identified as the most lonely is not the older demographic that people have come to expect. Instead it’s millennials – the first generation to grow up connected and connecting via digital communications.
Modern millennials send 293 billion emails each day. Of the 24 hours it takes for the earth to move around the sun, they spend an average of 142 minutes on social media and one in ten admits to checking in on their smartphone every ten minutes. Yet despite all these ‘conversations’, levels of loneliness have doubled since the 1980s.
And this impact is starting to reach beyond millennials. Findings from a global study carried out on Lipton’s behalf looked to ascertain insights into the concept of loneliness. It saw interviews with 2,000 participants aged 18+ across nine countries. Some 40% of those who took part felt their social relationships were superficial. One-third said they felt starved of company and three in ten admitted to feeling lonely.
Beyond a soft health concern
And the consequences of such levels of loneliness go beyond the lost art of conversation. Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called loneliness a serious health concern. Alongside mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, loneliness can impact sleep quality, reasoning and productivity. It’s been linked to a 29% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease and considered as damaging to health as smoking a packet of cigarettes a day.
“We’ll go to the doctor when we feel flu-ish or a nagging pain,” says psychologist and author Dr Guy Winch, who is working with Lipton. “So why don’t we see a health professional when we feel emotional pain such as loneliness?”
“We say things like ‘Oh, you are feeling depressed or lonely, shake it off, it’s all in your head. Can you imagine saying that to someone with a broken leg?” he says in his TED Talk ‘Why we all need to practice emotional first aid.’
In a connected world you may not associate your circumstances with feelings of loneliness. But, says Dr Winch, “loneliness is defined purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you.” Which means you may be surrounded by people every day and fill many hours of your life on social media and still feel alone.
And this is really where Lipton’s new brand purpose comes in. “Lipton has always been a brand that created connections,” says Lipton’s Global Vice President, Jennifer Antczak. “Tea really helps people to be present in the moment. And that is exactly what a quality connection is. It is a genuine connection where you are present in the moment and feel truly engaged with the other person.”
Social isolation can be as damaging to your health as smoking a packet of cigarettes a day. “But Lipton has found that just 15 minutes of quality conversation a day can reduce our chances of feeling lonely. Lipton Global VP, Jennifer Antczak 
“Because we are time poor, finding time to call someone, to chat or connect can fall off our to-do lists,” she adds. “But what if your daily ‘to do’ list also had a ‘to who’ that you reached out to?
“The beauty is you don’t need any special agenda to share a cup of tea. It doesn’t need much planning either. It can be as simple as messaging a person and saying ‘You. Me. Tea. Now.’ and then catching up over a cup of tea.”
To show that sometimes priorities get in the way of things that really matter, Lipton set up a social experiment that was filmed. This showed what happened when two very different groups of people were asked to create a daily to-do list. One was a room full of adults, the other a room full of children.
Priorities on top of the adults’ to-do list included ‘pay utility bill’ and ‘focus on work presentation’. The children’s list included ‘play with my best friend’ and ‘hug my mom’.
“Many people feel they don’t have enough time to connect with others,” acknowledges Jennifer Antczak. “But Lipton has found that just 15 minutes of quality conversation a day can reduce our chances of feeling lonely.”
“A hundred years ago, people began practising personal hygiene and life expectancy rates rose over 50% in just a matter of decades,” says Dr Winch. “I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practising emotional hygiene.”
“Part of that practising could be as simple as reaching out and having a cup of tea to reconnect with someone,” adds Jennifer Antczak. “Whether it is a colleague or a friend you haven't been in touch with for a while or a new neighbour who has recently moved to your area, just be present and truly engaged with people,” she says.
text This week saw leaders from business, government and the climate community, in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly and the City of New York, come together to drive climate action. Fast.
Because the numbers are clear. Climate change is costing the earth.
This year, Pakistan experienced flash floods that saw lives lost and millions of homes ruined while Europe faced its worst drought in 500 years. Natural disasters like these, exacerbated by climate change, cost the world $210 billion in 2020, a financial outlay that not only impacts communities but also the economies, businesses and infrastructure that serve them.
Climate risk impacts financial risk
Mitigating risks like these is one of the most cited financial reasons for investing in climate action. Money spent on equipment, emergency logistics, damaged products and lost sales is clearly visible on corporate balance sheets.
But the business case for investing in sustainability should not just focus on risk but also opportunity.
“Increasingly, companies are changing their business models to embed sustainability in their corporate strategy,” says Chief Supply Chain and Business Operations Officer, Reginaldo Ecclissato. But while 86% of organisations have a sustainability strategy in place, only 35% have acted on that strategy.
Unilever is one of them.
And we’re making sure that commitment is loud and clear to our consumers and the investment community.
The business case for decarbonising our business
We believe in a business model that can serve shareholders and stakeholders simultaneously. That can be a growth engine providing economic opportunity and climate justice. As a global company, it is impossible for us to do our fiduciary duty without considering climate change, destruction of nature and social inequality.
In 2021, we unveiled our Climate Transition Action Plan setting ourselves the goal of reducing our greenhouse emissions to zero by 2030, and those across our value chain to net zero by 2039.
“We were the first company in the world to put our decarbonisation plan to a shareholder vote,” CEO Alan Jope told a business audience in New York. It was supported by 99.6% of our investors.
“Stating that we have a climate emergency is becoming an unpopular thing to do,” Jope adds. “We will not back down on this agenda.”
Across our operations, we’re working with suppliers at local and state level to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Our Future Foods commitments are working to transform global food systems and reduce the impact of waste. Home Care’s Clean Future initiatives are replacing 100% of black carbon from fossil fuels with a carbon rainbow of renewable or recycled alternatives, while our Beauty and Personal Care brands are helping improve health and wellbeing through Positive Beauty.
As well as decarbonising our product portfolio, we’re investing €1 billion in our Climate &Nature Fund to help combat climate change over the next ten years and we’ve lent our support to the COP26 call for $100 billion/yearto support developing countries to take action on climate issues.
While all these investments are driven by a business looking to do good, they are also initiatives that are good for our business.
Attracting consumers through brands that commit to climate
In an IBM survey of 16,000 consumers in ten major economies, 51% said that environmental stability is more important to them than it was a year ago, and 49% paid a premium for products branded as sustainable or socially responsible.
“By sourcing sustainable ingredients and using recycled and recyclable packaging, we’re making it easy for consumers to choose the brands they already trust, knowing that they don’t cause harm,” says Chet Henderson, VP, Consumer Insights team.
And that strategy is bringing results.
Today, our 13 billion dollar brands shaped by sustainability and purpose account for more than 50% of our group turnover. In the first half of this year, they also delivered 9.4% underlying growth.
Winning the war on talent
And it’s not just consumers who seek out sustainability from companies. One in three people who changed jobs last year accepted a role with an employer they consider to be environmentally sustainable, and 34% took a role where they could directly influence environmentally sustainable outcomes.
As the graduate employer of choice in more than 50 companies, we recognise our climate credentials are a key part of winning the war on talent. And with BCG research showing that companies who attract high-calibre candidates achieve 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.1 times the average profit margin, we look forward to seeing how these future leaders can impact our bottom line.
Investment will determine the quality of our future lives
But while we can share our story and commitment to climate investment – it’s one story. The world needs more businesses to act sustainably and more investors to back them, and wider multilateral goals to succeed in keeping temperatures below -1.5°C.
“There’s a $3 trillion spread between what we’re doing and what needs to happen,” Tom Steyer, co-founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, told investors and financiers at Climate Week.
That means investors and financiers need to “invest and underwrite with intent,” says Jason Storah, CEO of Aviva Canada, a member of the UN Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, and that capital is mobilised to find low carbon solutions.
Investment communities are taking note.
Larry Fink’s investment company Blackrock has the ear of Wall Street and beyond thanks to the $10 trillion it manages. In his annual letter to CEOs, he was clear: “Stakeholder capitalism is not woke, it is capitalism.”
And momentum is gathering. Fiona Reynolds is CEO of Principles for Responsible Investment, a Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance created between her company and the UN’s Environment Programme Finance Initiative.
It can cite members from 50 of the world's largest asset owners that have more than $7 trillion in assets under management.
That weight of capital is now being directed towards making a climate difference, with the Alliance committing to transitioning their investment portfolios by 2050. They have also set targets for 2025.
Governments are beginning to act too, with New Zealand one of the few countries to have enshrined its 2050 net zero emissions target in law. It has allocated NZ$4.5 billion to a Climate Emergency Response Fund in its 2022 budget, alongside its pre-budget commitment of NZ$2.9 billion to the Emissions Reduction Plan.
So the direction of travel is clear.
But more of the investment community need to mobilise their funds for climate. As Reynolds says, “investing as usual isn’t going to cut it.”
We no longer have the luxury of time. “Established systems have their own inertia, and even if a better future is possible,” says Thomas Lingard, Unilever’s Global Climate and Environment Director, “it won’t happen unless enough people and organisations stand up to show how it can be done, to advocate both for the business action that is necessary, and the changes to the policy frameworks that would enable it.”
Choices need to be made to rebuild the world in a healthy way. If investors and financiers pull together with governments, NGOs and sustainable business, we can get things done.

text Back in March when the Covid-19 crisis first took hold in the United States, Unilever moved quickly to create United for America: an initiative designed to support communities in need during the pandemic.
Launched as part of our global commitment to contribute €100 million to protect lives and livelihoods, United for America is a long-term venture with a first phase to provide product donations and to unite our employees, suppliers and partners in a national Day of Service.
As part of this, Unilever is collaborating with Feeding America and Direct Relief to share $20 million (€18.2 million) worth of food, hygiene products, medical supplies and other critical items with these aid organisations whose local networks are well-placed to ensure they reach those most in need.
In the past two months more than 1.86 million products have been donated to communities most affected by Covid-19, and 200,000 face masks have been donated to hospitals along with a $2 million (€1.8 million) donation to Direct Relief from Dove and Vaseline to help fund personal protective equipment, ventilators and medicines.
The first Day of Service
Last week, United for America made its biggest impact to date with its first annual Day of Service event on Thursday 21 May, enlisting nearly 100 suppliers and partners, and thousands of employees both in front line operations and at home to provide products, time and gratitude to those affected by Covid-19.
On the Day of Service, we pledged that the equivalent value of one day’s worth of products manufactured at our US factories – $12 million or close to €10.9 million – would be donated to United for America’s community partners for distribution. The donation comprised bottles, packs, jars and boxes from Unilever brands including Dove, Seventh Generation, Suave, Knorr, Love Beauty and Planet and many more.
Unilever employees across the US also volunteered thousands of hours of their time during the day, providing support to national and local relief organisations in a variety of ways such as mentoring young people virtually, providing support at food banks, donating blood, and sewing masks. More than 90 partners from the media sector, our supply chain and a range of other industries also joined the efforts, creating one of the largest community support endeavours in Unilever history.
Finally, to recognise the incredible work being done by food bank teams across the US through the pandemic, we invited consumers, partners and employees to send them personal notes of thanks. More than 4,100 messages were written and shared.
A partnership built on purpose
“We are only just seeing the beginnings of the impact this crisis will have, and we are committed to providing access to food and household essentials Americans need,” said Fabian Garcia, President of Unilever North America.
“I am so inspired by our Unilever employees who are taking action and I’m thankful that a number of organisations, individuals and partners across industries have joined us in support of this movement. Only by working together can we amplify our impact and help more Americans.”

text To ensure a deforestation-free supply chain, we need to be able to trace our ingredients all the way back to where they are grown. For a product like palm oil, the first mile from the plantation or farm where the oil palm fruit – also called fresh fruit bunches (FFB) – are harvested to the point where they are processed is often where we need the most visibility.
Tracing what goes on in that critical first mile is not always straightforward. Conventionally, companies have drawn a 50 km radius around the mills in their supply chain and assumed the farms or plantations in those areas are likely to be supplying the mills. FFB need to be processed within 24 hours of harvesting, so it was widely accepted that mills would therefore source from nearby farms.
However, given the complexity of palm oil supply chains, we believe that the way we monitor this needs to be improved so that we can verify that our sourcing is not linked to deforestation.
We know that, while some produce will go straight from farm to mill, sometimes the oil palm fruit is traded through a middleman, with fresh fruit bunches being dropped off and picked up at informal collection points. These collection points can be far away from where the fruit was grown, making it harder to determine whether the fruit was produced sustainably or not without concrete data.
But now, working with our partner Premise, we are creating a community of local people in Indonesia who will help us track the palm from point of origin to processing.
Putting the power in people’s hands
Our pilot recruits mill workers and suppliers to provide photos and information about collection points and ramps via Premise’s digital crowdsourcing platform. Contributors are taught, through Premise’s platform, how to collect insights in a way that respects people and property laws and in line with Indonesia’s regulations.
Premise runs the sourced material through its AI-powered quality control system to verify the credibility of the photos and to ensure collection points aren’t being double counted. This helps us to build up a better picture of previously undocumented parts of the palm supply chain operating in the area.
In Aceh province in Sumatra, Indonesia, where we ran the pilot, we were able to identify and document more than 5,000 collection points in a single region. This gives us a much more informed understanding of where the oil palm that supplies us is being grown.
We can integrate this with the rest of our sourcing information, joining the dots for a fuller picture of our supply chain and enabling us to take more targeted action to improve it – whether that’s rolling out more support for smallholder farmers or starting new conversations with our suppliers.
A united large-scale effort
We are now developing a model for scaling the project up, which will include inviting suppliers and other consumer goods companies to join in.
“Individuals, either as consumers or part of an organisation, can often feel helpless in the face of challenges like deforestation or climate change. Our partnership with Premise is changing that, by inviting people on the ground to help us follow the journey raw materials take in the first mile of the supply chain,” says Andrew Wilcox, Senior Manager, Sustainable Sourcing and Digital Programmes, Unilever.
“We believe our pilot in Aceh is the world’s first case of large-scale crowdsourcing technology being applied to commodity sourcing. Technology is a powerful enabler of supply chain traceability and transparency, and crowdsourcing and partnerships are critical to building the capabilities Unilever, and the world, urgently needs to tackle deforestation.”
With consumers increasingly demanding to know where the products they purchase came from and the prospect of potential bans on commodities linked to deforestation, we’re not only safeguarding the environment by making sure our supply chains are sustainable, we’re also future-proofing our business.
text Around the world, people take a pause for tea 100 billion times a year. Now Lipton wants to turn those moments into something much more meaningful.
The brand is partnering with non-profit organisation Peace One Day to mark the UN’s International Day of Peace today (21 September) – a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace.
In a year in which so many of us have been kept apart, the need for genuine human connection is stronger than ever. And so Lipton is putting its purpose into practice and encouraging the world to take time to listen and connect with others.
Along with Peace One Day, the brand is inviting billions to enjoy a tea, take a moment, and invest 15 minutes in a connection that counts.
That quarter of an hour is time well spent. Lipton’s research shows that just 15 minutes of peaceful human connection can have a positive impact on our wellbeing and happiness.
Taking it global
To share the message, Lipton and Peace One Day took over iconic clock towers and landmarks around the world. They went from Australia to Malaysia, passing by UAE, and across Europe in the UK, France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Then it was on to Latin America with Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil.
The call to action ‘Tea Time. Peace Time.’ illuminated buildings and billboards crossing six time zones, in countdown to support Peace One Day reaching a potential audience of more than 4 billion people in just 24 hours. A move designed to inspire many more reclaimed moments of peace and positivity.
Lipton has already encouraged employees from all over the world to make time to connect and show what peace means to them. As Lipton is also a joint venture between PepsiCo and Unilever, colleagues from PepsiCo have been taking part in Lipton Tea Time Peace Time too.
“It’s been a tough year for all of us,” says Frank Haresnape, Pepsi Lipton Chief Marketing Officer.
“Humans are social beings, and we all miss normality and the ability to informally connect with others. There’s plenty of evidence that this is taking a toll on our mental wellbeing. So this is a moment to celebrate and encourage human connection. Because peace and wellbeing flourish when we do.”
Putting mental wellbeing on the agenda
A Peace One Day Live event is also taking place online today, calling for a day of unity and challenging virtual delegates to take action to make peace in their everyday lives.
The event will feature guest speakers including Unilever’s Global President of Foods & Refreshment Hanneke Faber, representing Lipton on this year’s ‘Peace of Mind’ panel. Members of the panel will be discussing mental health and the key issues and challenges faced by many people today. Watch the discussion at 20:30 BST to hear more about why mental wellbeing matters so much, especially in today’s uncertain times.
Other speakers on the event’s schedule include actor Jude Law, who has been a Peace One Day ambassador for more than a decade, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, and many more celebrities, changemakers, leaders and activists.
text About the author
Logistics Manager Benelux, Unilever Netherlands
We set bold targets at Unilever, and logistics is no exception. By 2020 we believe we will have cut our logistics carbon emissions by 40% compared to a 2010 baseline. At the end of 2018 we hit 38%. Our ambition is to be carbon neutral before 2030. It’s been a long hard road to get to where we are today. To reach zero emissions the world has a lot further to travel.
In logistics, costs and carbon go hand in hand. In most cases, activities that cut costs also reduce emissions. Our strategy rests on two pillars: reducing the kilometres we need to travel and greening the kilometres we have to travel. It’s seen us developing ways to fill our trucks more efficiently and shrink the distances travelled across our network.
One of the ways to reduce the kilometres we need to travel is by having different pallet heights for transporting our goods, to try to find the best option for loading our trucks most efficiently.
We’ve also worked on optimising our logistics network by locating factories and warehouses closer to large areas of consumer demand. Direct despatch from factories to customers is another way to shorten the distance our products need to travel.
Greening the kilometres we have to travel is more complex and involves investing in new technologies and alternative fuels. This is what excites and sometimes frustrates me the most.
We have an industry that wants to transition away from diesel, but without readily available zero emission alternatives on the market. We need heavy goods vehicles that can carry large volumes without contributing to air pollution and climate change.
But change is coming. Earlier in the year the European Commission introduced binding carbon dioxide reduction targets for trucks in the EU, including a stimulus for the development of zero- and low-emission trucks.
Poor air quality is an increasing concern in developed as well as developing nations.Google, for example, has just released a new digital tool that will allow a selection of European cities to measure levels of air pollution.
And rising consumer awareness of air pollution and its potential health impacts is driving innovation among vehicle and fuel manufacturers.
The year 2020 could be the breakthrough year for electric passenger cars. Heavy duty vehicles will take longer. There is a lot of excitement about the first generation of hydrogen- and battery-powered electric trucks and there are plenty of signals that the industry is getting ready. But it’s not going to happen overnight.
To move forward and continue reducing emissions today, fleets have to look at transition fuels. These are fuels that are cleaner than diesel but still contribute to climate change and air pollution.
For example, in the Netherlands we have a fleet running on liquified natural gas (LNG) which has lower carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions when compared to diesel. In Sweden, some of our vehicles are run on biofuel made from vegetable fats and oils.
What’s challenging is waiting for industry thinking and infrastructure to catch up with the potential of the new fuels available. With LNG we faced a chicken-and-egg situation where the fuel was viable, but Europe’s roads didn’t offer a sufficiently large network of LNG fuelling stations to ensure that our trucks could complete their journeys.
This led to our setting up a consortium, Connect2LNG, to build five LNG fuelling stations in France and Germany because you can’t have LNG-powered trucks without the infrastructure there to support them.
Our aim was to kickstart greater LNG use across Europe and it is not happening at scale – yet. That is part of working on new things. Every success is built on learning from failures. You just have to stay committed to positive change to navigate through the difficult times.
One of our bigger successes – the one I’m most proud of – is our partnership with the British business, Dearman Engine Company. We worked with them to trial and scale up a new technology to provide clean cooling for our refrigerated trailers through the use of liquid nitrogen, where the only emissions are air or nitrogen.
For six months we ran a trial with a Dearman’s transport refrigeration unit. The truck travelled more than 18,000km to collect and deliver Ben & Jerry’s and Ola ice cream – all powered by clean cold air. 
For six months we ran a trial where a Dearman’s transport refrigeration unit was fitted onto one of our ice cream transportation trucks in the Netherlands. Over 26 weeks, the truck travelled more than 18,000km to collect and deliver Ben & Jerry’s and Ola ice cream – all powered by clean cold air.
There were a few bumps in the development process, but trials in the Netherlands and Italy are now at a point where we are getting ready to launch a mini fleet in early 2020 and Dearman’s technology is getting commercially ready to hit the market and have an impact at scale.
We have been an important part of the product development cycle by opening up our supply chain to test innovative climate change solutions in real-life situations, allowing Dearman to learn from our experience.
What’s important to emphasise is that all these fuels and innovations are not competing with each other. There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution. We need a lot of different elements coming together.
The emphasis on greener logistics is only going to accelerate. We need urgent action on climate change and we can’t succeed without changing our transport system.
This is an area where we as Unilever wants to take responsibility. With the help of our logistics suppliers we can drive forward the market for greener solutions.
In the next ten years, things will change much more quickly than they have in the past 100 years. This means setting up new relationships with different types of companies, beyond the usual collaborations.
Because there is no one silver bullet to achieve zero emissions, the industry needs to work to get there together along many different pathways.
text Agarapathana, in the heart of the hills of Sri Lanka, is the base for Ceytea, Unilever’s instant tea factory. The site’s 153-strong workforce produces 2,500 metric tons of ready-to-drink tea powder for our Lipton iced tea business each year.
Every day the factory generated five tons of waste tea sludge. Ceytea’s factory manager, Anusha Kotalawala and her team were working to find ways to reduce this and its environmental impact.
Their solution was originally a problem on their ‘to-do’ lists. “The waste tea sludge was staining our factory uniforms,” says Anusha.
“The idea that this could be an opportunity came to light when we were approached by Professor Vinitha Thadhani, a senior research scientist and inventor from SLINTECH, Sri Lanka’s leading Nano-Tech Institute,” explains Anusha. “She was undertaking research in natural dyes and we literally came up in a Google search.
“We started to think, could the tea stains on our uniforms actually be an opportunity to develop a fabric dye from our own tea?” she says.
Testing the idea
“We knew that to create a natural plant dye, the supply chain, cost and, most importantly, reproducibility, had to be developed and tested,” Anusha explains. “Not all plant dyes give a dye that holds fast to light and washing.” That meant SLINTECH and Ceytea also required a partner from the textile industry – and this was garment-dyeing and wash firm Dynawash.
The three enterprises partnered up to move the idea forward. “We supplied the base ingredient, SLINTEC carried out the R&D, and Dynawash worked on the fabric dyeing and commercialisation, all with the help of funding from the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka,” says Anusha.
It took nearly three years of research and one year of research and development for SLINTEC to come up with a process that created an effective dye that met industry standards. And that’s pretty fast in R&D terms.
What helped, says SLINTEC’s senior research scientist, Professor Thadhani, was “the uniformity of the raw material, and that it came in a ready-to-use soluble powder or liquid concentrate just like synthetic dyes”.
It’s amazing how far we have come, the tea sludge used to get all over our clothes. Today, all of our uniforms are created from fabric that has been dyed with natural dye made from our own tea. Ceytea factory manager Anusha Kotalawala 
From waste to wardrobe
Today, as well as producing instant tea powder, the Ceytea factory manufactures the base ingredient for a suite of natural fabric dyes. The brand name for the dyes is T-Hues, a lovely reference to where they came from.
The process sees the tea waste segregated, filtered and spray-dried to create the base for tea dye in powder form. This can then be transformed into a range of 15 natural colours to suit textile manufacturers’ needs.
As a sector the fashion industry could account for more than 8% of global climate impacts and textile production plays a big part in that.
“There is a big push from global brands to make the apparel supply chain sustainable under the ZDHC initiative: a collaboration of major fashion brands, value chain affiliates and associations driving global implementation of safer chemical management practices,” acknowledges Dynawash’s CEO, Shahid Sangani.
Colouring a garment using a non-toxic, biodegradable and eco-friendly natural dye such as T-Hues cuts water consumption and dyeing time, and could reduce the carbon footprint from dyeing a cotton crew neck t-shirt by three-quarters and a nylon T-shirt by one-third.
“It’s amazing how far we have come,” adds Anusha. “The tea sludge used to get all over our clothes. Today, all of our uniforms are created from fabric that has been dyed with natural dye made from our own tea.”
And workwear is just the start. The T-hues team are in the process of presenting ranges of naturally dyed scarves, shawls, hoodies and t-shirts to big retailers, including the UK’s Marks & Spencer.
“We’re very proud to have developed a sustainable natural dye from our tea waste,” says Anusha. “It not only has great social and economic benefits for Sri Lanka but also it helps us take another step forward in making sustainable living commonplace.”
text Last year Unilever’s hand sanitiser business represented an important but small part of our global Beauty & Personal Care portfolio.
One popular product came from our Lifebuoy brand: a range of gels designed to appeal to young children and their hygiene-conscious parents, adorned with cartoon characters and fitted with schoolbag-friendly clips. Sales and market share were stable and there was clear potential for growth – but no one could have foreseen quite what 2020 would bring.
In the weeks since Covid-19 took hold, we’ve moved at a pace that was previously almost unimaginable to help prevent the spread of infections. Since January, we’ve gone from producing about 700,000 items a month to around 100 million items, and increased production capacity worldwide by more than 600 times in tonnage as hand hygiene became a vital way to fight the virus.
We’ve mobilised people, partners, retailers and resources to scale up our hand sanitiser production capabilities significantly. And we’ve delivered on the demands of retailers and governments across the globe who have been eager to secure supplies of this increasingly essential item.
We caught up with Vice President of Supply Chain for Skin Cleansing and Skin Care, Ampy Aswin, to find out more.
Ampy, what were some of the early actions Unilever took to begin addressing the increase in demand for hand sanitisers?
When news of the Covid-19 outbreak first came out, towards the end of Chinese New Year in late January, it felt like we were responding to an emergency call. We knew that as a business we could do something to help, and that speed was of the essence.
Within 24 hours a fully empowered squad was set up from brand teams, Supply Chain, R&D and Unilever International.
We started working out how we could ramp up production of hand sanitisers immediately.
How did you get that process underway?
Our first priority was addressing the needs in China quickly, and within days we extended that remit globally so that we could do our very best to meet demand on a wider scale if the pandemic spread.
We contacted multiple third parties to see if they could support us. To say that we had a positive response is an understatement. We couldn’t travel to visit factories but through virtual reviews we assessed risk factors thoroughly from a distance, and rapidly added several sites to our list of production partners.
At the last count, we’ve increased from two to 57 third-party partners and they’re located all over the world from Mexico to Malaysia, Australia, Italy, Canada, South Africa and dozens more countries. We’ve also adapted some Unilever sites to produce sanitisers, and learnt from the experts in our deodorants business who know about working with flammable liquids (like deos, hand sanitiser contains alcohol). Our factory in Vietnam was the first to make a major change, switching production to hand sanitiser in just 25 days.
How did you move so quickly?
It helped that we had a very clear purpose: increasing the supply of hand sanitiser to meet an enormous surge in demand. That galvanised everyone into action. And across the wider team, we agreed a framework that gave us freedom to make decisions fast and deploy expertise where needed.
We made some compromises too. As long as the products could meet the WHO standards of a minimum of 60% ethanol content in sanitiser, we decided we wouldn’t worry about bottle shapes or designs. When the priority is meeting demand during a pandemic, how the products look is much less important.
Tapping into Unilever International’s great network for distribution also enabled us to act quickly.
What have been some of your personal highlights so far?
In May we had a request from a major US retailer. They were keen to secure an extremely large order of sanitiser packs and because they didn’t believe one supplier would be able to provide that kind of volume, they had asked multiple businesses if they could help.
We contacted our network and partners to see what was feasible and worked closely with our colleagues in the US to see what we could do. The next day we confirmed that Unilever would be able to deliver the entire amount. The retailer was surprised but delighted.
This entire programme has been the most intense experience of my career but I’m so proud of what we’re doing.
It started with Lifebuoy, but several more Unilever brands have now introduced hand sanitisers and entered new markets. How has that evolved?
It’s been exciting to see that happen – and so fast. We know we can deliver to meet the demand so now it’s about differentiating our products, remaining relevant to brand identities, and launching lines that consumers will enjoy using. We now produce more than 50 different packs of hand sanitiser across the business.
Lifebuoy has introduced aerosol sprays in addition to its gels. Lux’s range has fantastic fragrances. And brands such as Rexona in Latin America and Suave in US, which until now didn’t offer hand hygiene products, have launched sanitisers which meet WHO’s standards.
So with Covid-19 still spreading, do you think hand sanitisers will continue to increase in popularity?
Lifebuoy first launched hand sanitisers during the SARS pandemic. Demand during that time still remained quite low. With Covid-19 it’s different. This is global, and the scale that we’re seeing is unprecedented.
We are very likely to see long-term changes in people’s behaviour around using hygiene products in a variety of situations. While the small travel-size packs are very popular for using on the go, larger sanitation stations may prove essential for hotels, restaurants and office buildings in the future too. We’ll continue doing all we can to ensure people can access these products whenever and however they need them.

Chief Sustainability Officer
Rebecca is responsible for driving Unilever’s overall sustainability strategy
and transformational change in priority areas for the USLP and Compass, such as
climate change, the circular economy and opportunities for women.
As the United Nations marks its 75th anniversary this year, its purpose – to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations and promote social progress – is more relevant today than it has ever been.
The worst global health crisis in its history is a stark reminder of the need for closer co-operation across borders, sectors and generations.
To celebrate this 75-year milestone, our Chief Sustainability Officer Rebecca Marmot – who has worked closely with the UN for many years – reflects on our partnership and some of our successful collaborations.
A radical idea for a complex world
Anyone born after 1945 doesn’t know a world without the UN. However, the concept that every country should come together to figure out solutions to problems was radical when the UN was created after the Second World War.
In a world that had been savaged by many conflicts, there was an appetite for greater collaboration to try and solve the various challenges through sharing perspectives and co-operation, even if they are different.
This ushered in a new era of multilateral diplomacy and an institution was born with a remit that covered a whole range of issues.
As well as emergency missions, refugee work and peacekeeping, the UN is involved in everything from environmental protection and sustainable development, to human rights and gender equality.
The wider view
As the UN grew, there was a realisation that solutions wouldn’t come from multilateral diplomacy alone. The rise of globalisation meant that multi-sector and cross-sector engagement – between public, private and civil society – was needed.
In 2006, the UN Global Compact created a formal space that could bring member states together with representatives from businesses, trade unions or other groups. For Unilever, this was the start of a close and enduring partnership.
A respected voice
Unilever’s purpose – to make sustainable living commonplace – is closely aligned to the mission of the UN. So many of the issues that the UN works on are very pertinent to those that we care about as a business. We regularly provide the private sector perspective in areas of common interest such as hygiene behaviour change and women’s empowerment.
Back in 2013, we helped develop a guide to business partnerships with the UN. This cemented Unilever as a respected voice from the business world and led to us being involved in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and crucially, the evolution of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The scale and reach of companies such as Unilever mean we can both contribute to and benefit from this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve society and the environment. Rebecca Marmot 
Helping to shape the Global Goals and the Paris Agreement
The MDGs provided some common development targets and while a certain amount of progress was made, it was uneven. What’s more, the private sector wasn’t properly involved. The UN decided to run a series of consultations on what to do in 2015 when the MDGs came to an end.
Our CEO at the time, Paul Polman, was invited to join Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s High-Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. As part of that, we helped shape a proposal for what went on to become the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The UN SDGs are the global plan to create a better world. They address poverty, hunger and climate change, alongside other issues central to human progress and sustainable development – such as gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and responsible consumption and production.
The scale and reach of companies such as Unilever mean we can both contribute to and benefit from this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve society and the environment, and the growth in economies that comes with delivering the SDGs.
If companies fail to get behind the SDGs, the costs and uncertainty of doing business will swell. On the other hand, if a critical mass joins the movement, it will create an unstoppable force for good.
How we drive change
To tackle global issues relevant to Unilever and drive change, we use a model based on three pillars: advocacy, partnerships and scale.
We advocate for wider systems change to improve the operating environment. We do this by working with partners to influence decisions on topics that are important to both our short- and long-term business goals, for example, food systems, plastic and climate.
We drive action through partnerships with several UN agencies. For instance, we work with UN Women to advance our efforts on gender equality (SDG 5), and also with UNICEF in areas such as clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). We bring this to life through our brands, for example, our UNICEF partnership with Domestos and Lifebuoy.
We then scale these advocacy and partnership activities to maximise our impact. This can be through working with governments, such as in India on its progressive water, sanitation and hygiene programmes. Increasingly, we’re able to reach millions more people through mobile and digital activations.

text Most cleaning products contain surfactants – chemicals that create foam to break down oil, grease and soil. These compounds are typically made from petrochemicals – a non-renewable, carbon-heavy resource. Rhamnolipids are different – they are a biosurfactant and in this case are made using sugar as their main raw material.
We have been working with world-leading chemical specialists Evonik for several years now, looking to develop the use of rhamnolipids in our cleaning products. The biosurfactant has great potential to help reduce the cleaning industry’s carbon impact and as well as being fully biodegradable, with a low-impact life-cycle, it’s also ultra-mild on skin.
Rolling out rhamnolipids
When we started using it in Unilever’s Quix dishwashing brand in Chile in 2019, it was the first time the biosurfactant had been used in a household cleaning product anywhere in the world. Following this successful pilot and the biosurfactant’s introduction into our Sunlight hand dishwash in Vietnam, we were keen to roll it out across our global hand dishwash portfolio.
Now, our partner Evonik has announced the creation of a state-of-the-art production facility at its factory in Slovenská Ľupča, Slovakia, we can begin to do so. It will be the world’s first industrial-scale plant creating rhamnolipids and our partnership is helping to drive it forward.
“Rhamnolipids are an important part of our Clean Future initiative, which has set the goal to replace virgin fossil carbon in all our cleaning product formulations with renewable or recycled carbon instead. We want to make sustainability easy for everyone who uses our products. The partnership with Evonik helps move our brands away from fossil fuels while delivering the great clean our consumers expect and new benefits such as mildness on skin,” says Peter ter Kulve, President of Unilever Home Care.
Our exclusive partnership with Evonik also opens the possibility of using this biosurfactant in other areas of home care, as we work to fundamentally change the way our cleaning and laundry products are created, manufactured and packaged as part of our Clean Future strategy.
“The journey of rhamnolipids from the initial idea to the finished product has been long, but it is worth it. This partnership with Unilever is a result of our expertise in biotechnology,” says Harald Schwager, Evonik’s Chief Innovation Officer.

text ‘Zero carbon, zero waste’ for advertising production is the ultimate objective for AdGreen, a new sustainability initiative launched today by the Climate Action Working Group with the support of Unilever, Sky, WPP, Havas, adam&eveDDB, MullenLowe Group as part of IPG, and APR (Advertising Production Resources).
AdGreen hopes to empower the advertising production industry to measure, manage and ultimately reduce its carbon footprint. To do this, AdGreen will develop a carbon footprint calculator tool, specialist training, a renewable energy buy-in scheme and, later, certification and a high-quality offsetting scheme.
“We are determined our industry does everything in its power to respond to the climate emergency. AdGreen will make it possible for anyone producing ads to be confident that they can do it in a way that does not impact the climate – a fundamental change that we have to all make now,” says Stephen Woodford, Chief Executive of the Advertising Association.
Identifying the problem
AdGreen aims to help measure, manage and ultimately reduce the carbon footprint of advertising production
The project launches with two main aims: to measure the impact advertising production has on the environment and to identify which activities leave the heaviest carbon footprint.
“Ultimately, AdGreen means everyone producing advertising work will be able to capture and understand their own footprint data; advertisers and advertising agencies will be able to compare that to anonymised benchmarks,” explains Jo Coombes, Founder of AdGreen. “We want to build a future-proofed carbon-literate workforce, giving us the opportunity for the highest creative ambition with the lowest carbon impact.”
Going global
Advertising pollution is a global issue and can only be solved if everyone is committed to making the necessary changes.
Unilever works with hundreds of production suppliers and creative agencies globally, filming in over 60 countries and spending millions of euros annually on global advertising production. In line with Unilever’s wider environmental commitments, its AdPro team have for some time had a sustainability policy in place but needed a common industry approach and tools to effectively reduce emissions.
Setting foundations for a fairer future
Advertising pollution is a global issue that can only be solved through an industry-wide commitment to change
The AdGreen initiative provides a solution. “The work being done by the UK’s Advertising Association’s Climate Action group shares our objectives, with the benefit of being industry wide. We’re excited to get to work alongside our fellow founding members, to develop a tool that we can use throughout the world when executing Unilever’s advertising production,” says Dana Cadden, Head of Global Advertising Production, Global Marketing Services.
It is an aspiration that is shared by Unilever CEO Alan Jope: “What we do today is make or break. So we’re delighted to join our peers and other leading organisations to launch AdGreen, to push for real change in advertising production. Now is the time to commit to a fairer, zero-carbon world.”
The AdGreen initiative is also supported by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), the Advertising Producers Association (APA), the Association of Photographers (AOP) and the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA).
Unilever is a member of the UK Advertising Association Climate Action Working Group, which has launched the AdGreen project. Unilever’s EVP & General Manager of the UK & Ireland business, Sebastian Munden, is chair of the UK Advertising Association Climate Action Steering Group.

British environmentalist, broadcaster and Founder Director of Forum for the Future
Jonathon has been involved with environmental issues since 1974, is a former
director of Friends of the Earth, former Chair of the UK Sustainable Development
Commission, and non-Executive Director of Willmott Dixon.
To celebrate our 90th birthday, and help us look ahead to the next 90 years, we asked leading sustainability, purpose and business influencers to share their thoughts on how companies with purpose will be successful in the future.
I first started acting as an adviser to Unilever back in 1997, joining what was then called the Unilever Environment Group. I was told that one of the first things I should do would be to visit Port Sunlight to check out the museum and get a proper idea of just how radical William Lever’s vision for his soap factory was back in the 19th century.
So I did – and it was quite an experience. When Harvard University Professor Michael Porter created such a splash in 2006 with his ground-breaking idea of ‘shared value’, I couldn’t help but compare that with Lever’s shared prosperity model 120 years earlier.
Early sustainability ambitions
The Unilever Environment Group focused pretty tightly on basic environmental housekeeping matters and on some big ‘stewardship challenges’ – particularly the Forestry Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC).
In those days, Bird’s Eye was still a Unilever brand and had formed a partnership with WWF to address the massive challenge of overfishing around the world. ‘What’s the point of having a frozen fish business if there aren’t going to be any fish in the sea?’ was the call-to-arms of Bird’s Eye’s senior managers at the time.
This really was ground-breaking, and for all its ups and downs, the MSC is today an outstanding success story, giving consumers reliable information about the sustainability of the fisheries from which their cod or tuna or toothfish has been sourced.
The whole social agenda in Unilever was dealt with completely separately at that time, but eventually the integrated concept of sustainable development started to get a lot more traction across the company. It led to the establishment of the Unilever Sustainable Development Group, which in turn morphed into the Advisory Council for the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan in 2010.
If Earth-trashing economic growth and ruthlessly promoted consumerism, where everything has to be as cheap as possible for Western consumers, remain the drivers of what we think of as ‘progress’ today, compounded by continuing population growth, how can any company, even one as committed as Unilever, genuinely aspire to make a real difference? Jonathon Porritt 
Challenges for the next decade
Ten years on, Unilever is about to celebrate a pretty extraordinary record of success through the USLP, and although somewhat inevitably there are a number of targets that won’t be met before the end of the year, it’s still seen as a hugely inspiring exemplar of how a global fast-moving consumer goods company can reconcile the pursuit of growth and profit with being a force for good in the world on a host of environmental and social issues.
But only up to a certain point. One of the challenges for Unilever today is the uncomfortable knowledge that 20 years of excellent performance on its part (and on the part of the 20 or 30 global companies that are in the same sort of league) have done little to shift the needle on the three meta-crises we now face. These are the climate emergency; the erosion of the natural world and the threat of eco-system collapse; and the stubborn persistence of chronic and cruel inequality around the world, notwithstanding enormous improvements in longevity, health and education.
What does the concept of corporate sustainability mean in such a world? If Earth-trashing economic growth and ruthlessly promoted consumerism, where everything has to be as cheap as possible for Western consumers, remain the drivers of what we think of as ‘progress’ today, compounded by continuing population growth, how can any company, even one as committed as Unilever, genuinely aspire to make a real difference?
Companies are still obliged to create as much social and environmental value as they can, within the rules of the game. But the real test today is how outspoken will companies be in explicitly seeking to change the rules of that game.
So as CEO Alan Jope and his team work out how to build on the record of the USLP over the next ten years, it’s fair to say that it certainly doesn’t get any easier.

text About the author
Unilever Future Leader, Marketing, Unilever Kenya
Draganah joined Unilever Kenya straight from the University of Nairobi’s
business school in 2016. She leads the company’s U-Turn collection and recycling
programme in partnership with waste management company Mr Green Africa.
To celebrate our 90th birthday, and help us look ahead to the next 90 years, we asked leading sustainability, purpose and business influencers to share their thoughts on how companies with purpose will be successful in the future.
I feel privileged to be young in 2020. To be living in a magical age of technology and connectivity that brings people together from all corners of the world. To be working in a business that has a voice and action plans to address important issues affecting our world – from climate change to mental resilience, inclusion and the plastics crisis.
Being young is a gift – and one that we don’t get to keep for long. That’s why I’m determined to use my energy, spirit and vigour to live my purpose, step into the world and make a difference.
I’m trying to do that here in Kenya by launching and leading a programme to educate and encourage people across Nairobi, our capital city, to see the value in collecting and recycling the litter that plagues our streets. We’ve called it U-Turn.
People tend to throw their plastic waste aside, without a thought for the environment. They’re just used to seeing it discarded. But by teaching children to dispose of it in the right way, and by forging partnerships with local scavengers and recycling groups, we are turning that rubbish into something useful. We’re contributing to the circular economy, reducing plastic waste and showing future generations how we can care for our planet.
Thanks to support from Unilever’s Brighter Future Fund, we’ve been able to reach 190 schools across Nairobi with the message. We’ve got a blueprint for making positive change, and I believe this programme has huge potential. I’d love to reach every child in Kenya – in fact every child in East Africa! – and get this important lesson out there.
The enduring power of purpose
I’ve been given a chance to do this work alongside my day job, and I feel incredibly lucky to have that opportunity. To have the flexibility and support to do work that is so meaningful to me and to be able to live my purpose uninhibited by societal norms and expectations is a wonderful feeling.
Since it was created 90 years ago, Unilever has been an organisation with purpose etched into its DNA, and I think that makes all of us stronger. It helps to build a workforce of passionate, vibrant people that deliver tremendous business results. And that’s why I firmly believe that people with purpose thrive and companies with purpose will last.
If you are a consumer and you want to buy soap, then you’ll have dozens of options. But if it has a story, a reason that it offers more than the others, helps a community or protects health, then doesn’t that set it apart and above the rest?
That’s the power of companies with purpose. We think about consumers, about their needs and about making a better world beyond just selling products.
And to keep that innovative, ambitious spirit alive at Unilever for the next 90 years, I believe young people are absolutely vital in the process. We can’t keep doing things the way we always have done and expect change.
Businesses need fresh ideas. They need people who see opportunity without seeing the barriers that sometimes come with experience. Change is how we create things we haven’t seen before – and that’s why young people must be brought into decision-making and their ideas given the space and opportunities to try things out. Especially when it comes to putting purpose at the centre of everything we do.
It means everything to me. A chance to breathe real purpose into my role means I’m constantly inspired and motivated to make a mark on society. In just three years with Unilever, I already feel I have an opportunity to leave a legacy in this world.
text Most cleaning products contain surfactants. These are the compounds that create foam and enable the product to work: to break down oil, grease and soil to remove it from countertops, clothing and skin.
However, these surfactants are typically made from petrochemicals – a non-renewable resource.
We wanted to find an alternative that could not only wash dishes just as well as our best-performing products, but that is also made from renewable ingredients that are kinder to the planet.
And when you’re on the lookout for a solution offering such ‘natural’ characteristics, where better to look than nature itself.
Searching for the perfect combination
Microbes, plants and fungi all produce molecules with surfactant-like behaviour. Unilever Home Care has been exploring these ‘biosurfactants’ in partnership with Evonik, one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies.
What we discovered is that some micro-organisms can convert sugar into surfactants – in a similar way that yeast in beer breaks down sugar to make ethanol – resulting in the degreasing performance our consumers require, while ensuring excellent foaming and dirt removal qualities.
Using the latest advances in biotechnology, we can mirror the same process that happens in nature, but recreate it at a bigger scale by feeding bacteria with refined sugar, or even better, waste from the corn and maize industry.
The result of this breakthrough is Rhamnolipid, a type of surfactant found in nature which works in cleaning surfaces.
It’s a 100% renewable and 100% biodegradable ingredient, which delivers superior cleaning performance.
It works better in hard water areas. Typically, when cleaning products are used with hard water, their performance tends to degrade so you need to use more of them to get the same results.
Importantly, we have dermatologically tested it against irritation and allergies, and it’s also ultra-mild on skin, which sets it apart from other surfactant alternatives.
Peter ter Kulve, President of Unilever's Home Care business, says: “Our R&D team has been aware of Rhamnolipid for some years, but the technology and the science weren’t at a point where we were able to scale it. So it remained an invention in a lab, until now. That’s why we are so delighted to be partnering with Evonik. Together, our teams have worked hard to deliver a sustainable and safe product with even better performance.”
Our R&D team has been aware of Rhamnolipid for some years, but the technology and the science weren’t at a point where we were able to scale it. So it remained an invention in a lab, until now. Peter ter Kulve 
First stop, Chile
This innovative ingredient was introduced to the market this summer in our Quix dishwashing liquid in Chile – the first time it has been used in a cleaning product anywhere in the world.
This is an ideal test market because we know, through research, that consumers there care about their environment and natural resources. And while they are looking for natural cleaning products, they are not willing to compromise on performance.
Dr Hans Henning Wenk, Vice President of R&D at Evonik, says: “This is a key milestone and an important step in our journey to finding more sustainable solutions. It’s the first innovation of its kind to launch in household cleaning. It has the potential to fundamentally transform the way we produce cleaning ingredients and positively influence countless other industries going forward.”
Unilever is committed to scaling the innovation further, as well as exploring new technologies and innovations which offer renewable ingredients for our cleaning and laundry products.
text Everyone, everywhere, should have access to good food that doesn’t cost the earth. But what makes food good or bad? Nutrition? Taste? The impact it has on our planet? Or how it was grown and by whom?
All of these elements are factors in the food choices we make every day. But we don’t often think about the impact these choices have on people around the world, or on the planet itself.
Why our global food system isn’t working
The complicated, interlinked processes that bring food from field to fork are clearly failing a lot of people. There is too much waste and destruction of our natural resources.
We live in a world where 2 billion people are overweight, while 1 billion go hungry. Where more than 20% of all greenhouse gases are produced by the food industry, and yet a third of that food is thrown away.
As one of the largest food manufacturers in the world, we have a responsibility to help shape a global food system that is fair for everyone. That is why we are launching our ‘Future Foods’ initiative – it’s our plan to help people transition towards healthier diets and reduce the environmental impact of the food chain. In it we are committing to:
An annual €1 billion sales target from plant-based meat and dairy alternatives within five to seven years
Halve food waste in our direct operations from factory to shelf by 2025
Double the number of products that deliver positive nutrition by 2025
Continue to lower calories, salt and sugar across all our products.
These new targets also support our global commitments to deliver a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023; halve our use of virgin plastic by 2025; and achieve net-zero emissions for all products by 2039.
Making plant-based foods the new normal
So why plant-based foods? Animal agriculture is known to be the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions after fossil fuels and a cause of deforestation, water and air pollution and biodiversity loss. Reducing our meat consumption is essential. New research has shown that changing to a plant-based diet could reduce our individual carbon footprint by as much as 35%.
So we know that a diverse, plant-based diet is better for our health and the health of the planet. But if we want people to make the switch, we need plant-based options to be more accessible, affordable and appetising. They need to be the easy, obvious choice.
With a new sales target of €1 billion for plant-based alternatives, our customers will see a wider range of vegan and vegetarian options from our brands.
It’s an approach that is not just good for the planet, it’s good for business too. Two years after acquiring The Vegetarian Butcher, we have expanded this leading plant-based meat brand into 30 countries. Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise is now available in 33 countries and Ben & Jerry’s now has seven non-dairy alternatives. And Magnum’s first vegan ice cream was recognised with PETA’s best vegan ice cream award in 2019.
It’s not up to us to decide for people what they want to eat, but it is up to us to make healthier and plant-based options accessible to all Hanneke Faber, President of Unilever’s Foods & Refreshment Division. 
Halving food waste
In addition to changing the way we eat, rebalancing the world’s food system demands a reduction of food waste and loss. Currently, a third of the food produced globally is thrown away, and 40–45% of that waste comes from our own homes.
The economic and environmental consequences of this waste is huge, as Liz Goodwin, Senior Fellow and Director of the World Resources Institute, explains: “Food loss and waste has massive impacts in terms of cost to the global economy, the environment and society. We know that food loss and waste contributes about 8% of global greenhouse emissions as well as wasting the land and water used in production of food.”
As a signatory of the Champions 12.3 10x20x30 initiative, we had already committed to halving food waste by 2030. We’re now bringing forward that deadline to 2025.
“We need as many companies as possible to step up and prioritise the issue of food loss and waste and take action to reduce it,” adds Liz.
Rebalancing our food with more healthy options
The transition to healthier eating also requires us to reformulate our existing foods to comply with the highest nutritional standards.
Lowering the sugar, salt and calorie count in our products is central to this commitment. We’ve already introduced a 110 calorie cap on our children’s ice cream and lowered salt, sugar and calories in a growing number of products, including a 30% reduction of sugar in our Lipton Ice Tea.
Our Future Foods strategy aims to extend these reductions, so that 85% of our foods will help ensure consumers do not intake more than 5g of salt per day, by 2022. And 95% of our ice creams will not contain more than 22g of sugar, and 250 kcal per serving, by 2025.
Fighting food deficiencies with fortified options
We are also committed to producing more fortified foods. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2 billion people are still affected by micronutrient deficiency, but fortifying foods with small, safe doses of essential micronutrients such as vitamins A and D, iodine, iron and zinc is a simple way to counter this deficiency.
To this end, we plan to double the number of our products that can deliver positive nutritional value by 2025. This is defined as foods containing impactful amounts of vegetables, fruit, proteins or micronutrients such as zinc, iron, omega-3 and iodine.
Again, they will be following the well-established footprints of products such as Horlicks Classic, which is fortified with 21 micronutrients and has been a staple in South Asian households for generations.
Creating food that’s fit for the future
Of course, the success of these initiatives requires us to innovate so that we can hit these new health targets without compromising on taste.
Over 500 experts at our food innovation centre, The Hive, at the Wageningen campus in the Netherlands are working on creating a new generation of nourishing foods that are fit for the future. This is where biotech start-up Algenuity is working with our Foods and Refreshment R&D team to explore ways of bringing foods made with microalgae to market.
Collaboration like this is crucial if we are going to achieve our ambitious targets. That is why we are also reaching out to farmers, NGOs, universities and communities to work with us, so that we can create the sustainable change the world’s food system so desperately needs.
Be it Ben & Jerry’s ongoing Caring Dairy programme – paying a premium to farmers who use sustainable practices. Or Knorr teaming up with WWF UK to compile the Future 50 Foods report, highlighting what foods we should all be eating more of. The objective is the same: to help fix our food system so that it’s fair for everyone.
A force for good in food
“The average person’s daily diet will need to change drastically during the next three decades to make sure everyone is fed without depleting the planet. By transforming eating habits, improving food production and reducing food waste, we can begin to solve these problems,” says Jessica Fanzo, Bloomberg Distinguished Associate Professor of Global Food & Agricultural Policy and Ethics at Johns Hopkins University.
Jessica adds: “Unilever’s commitments are integral to helping people make changes to their diet, with products they know and love.”
Our Future Foods strategy not only marks our commitment to transform our foods business, it’s also our commitment to helping transform the world’s food system. Only then will everyone, everywhere, have access to healthy, affordable food that’s good for the planet.

text Every year, we recognise pioneering individuals within the company who have brought our values to life and truly embody what it means to be part of Unilever. Our 2019 Heroes with Impact have gone above and beyond their day-to-day jobs. Their stories paint a picture of passion, purpose and drive.
Kenya is awash with plastic litter. The problem is especially acute in the big cities. Nairobi, for example, produces around 2,400 tonnes of waste a day, of which roughly 60% is collected and only around 10% recycled. The rest is dumped illegally or burned.
“People dump everything without caring and it becomes the next-door neighbour’s problem,” says Draganah Omwange, Unilever Future Leader in Marketing. “This dumping is clogging the rivers and even the roads are becoming impassable.”
Draganah joined Unilever straight from university in 2016. She found her chance to get directly involved in an environmental initiative by mapping out a scheme to improve plastic waste recycling. She secured funding of €234,000 for the project from Unilever’s East Africa Brighter Future Fund.
At its heart was the recognition that children are the best agents of change. “Adults have firm, unshakeable beliefs,” she says. “But children are like a clean leaf and have a strong impact on their parents.”
The campaign was called U-Turn because it involved a change in mindset. Instead of seeing plastic as waste, the aim was to change the perception of waste in Kenya, starting with children as a way of getting future generations on board. Around 180 primary schools were enlisted, some of which are based in Kibera, Kenya’s biggest slum. Pupils collected discarded plastic containers and the schools provided collection points. Children are shown the value of keeping the environment clean and the benefits of recycling. “We are teaching them that ‘plastics equals value’,” adds Draganah.
The project partners with waste management company Mr Green Africa, which collects the plastic bottles from the schools and recycles them.
Everyone is a winner here. Collection is a prime challenge for waste recyclers, and the U-Turn scheme is providing a new source of plastic waste ready for recycling. The partnership has also created employment for over 2,700 waste pickers who help collect the waste.
And a new recycling culture is gaining traction, shifting entrenched attitudes towards plastic littering and turning waste into value. Over 1 million people have already been reached by the campaign. The U-Turn project is also being scaled up and extended to the cities of Kisumu and Mombasa.
The judges of the Unilever Heroes Awards praised this “great initiative in linking plastic recycling with job creation in Kenya”.
For Draganah, one of the enduring rewards of the project has been to see the positive influence it has had on the schoolchildren involved. “Listening to them singing and chanting – it makes me feel so proud,” she concludes.
text About the author
Piyush Jain is Global Brand Vice President for Love Beauty and Planet, as well
as our Dove and Lux Hair brands.
Sonika Malhotra is Love Beauty and Planet’s Global Brand Director.
Four years ago, Piyush Jain pulled together a small, hand-picked team with the remit of building a new brand, influenced by the fast-growing trend for natural ingredients. Sonika Malhotra soon joined the squad.
Together with a dedicated group of experts from across Unilever, they came up with Love Beauty and Planet. Now, as the brand publishes its first impact report, entitled Our Approach to Sustainability – which looks back at its achievements, challenges and lessons learnt – we caught up with its founders to hear the inside story.
Piyush: The Love Beauty and Planet journey began when we started to see an opportunity emerge in beauty products formulated with natural ingredients. We realised that there was an opportunity to create something completely new.
But just being new wasn’t enough. We wanted this brand to be unique. Completely differentiated from anything else in the business and with purpose well and truly at its heart. When we hit upon the name – Love Beauty and Planet – everything became clear. This brand would be great for you, and great for the planet too. A big promise, but one we were – and still are – absolutely focused on.
Sonika: That’s right. Our purpose came from a combination of logic and magic. We used science, research and analysis to look at the impact our products would have on the planet, from greenhouse gas emissions to being silicone-free or developing products with the potential to reduce consumers’ water use.
The magic came from working with incredible people who aligned with our purpose and shared their views on what they really wanted from a range.
Back then, it was still quite early to be making big commitments around plastic packaging, but having 100% recyclable packs and recycled bottles was non-negotiable for us. It was the same story with ethically sourced ingredients and Love Beauty and Planet is PETA-approved vegan, meaning we do not test on animals anywhere in the world. We knew from the outset what Love Beauty and Planet stood for and we didn’t move our goals.
Our purpose came from a combination of logic and magic. Sonika Malhotra, Co-founder and Global Brand Director, Love Beauty and Planet 
Piyush: We launched Love Beauty and Planet in 2018, starting with hair and skin care products in the US and Canada. Now the range covers every category within Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care division – adding skin cleansing, oral care and deodorants to the line-up.
Love Beauty and Planet is now available in 50 countries, and it’s moved beyond beauty to become a lifestyle brand with the launch of Love Home and Planet home care products.
Sonika: Scaling up so quickly certainly presented challenges – sourcing recycled plastic for our bottles, for example. Back in the early days, the supply chain simply wasn’t there. The recycled plastic available was strangely coloured, more expensive, more fragile. But we didn’t take no for an answer and in the end, we helped change the system. Now other Unilever brands have been able to follow, sourcing recycled plastic more easily because we helped push that door open.
We also adopted the philosophy that good intentions are sometimes better than perfection. We couldn’t get 100% recycled plastic bottle caps in time for launch. We could have waited a couple of years to launch with bottles and caps that were both completely recycled, but didn’t want consumers spending two more years choosing products in virgin plastic bottles. Instead, we launched and were very open about the fact that we were still working on our caps. We kept pushing and we’ve got them now.
Piyush: I’m immensely proud of what we’ve been able to achieve. We launched a completely new brand in a year and it was a journey of many firsts.
When we talked about creating the first fast-rinse conditioner, designed to help people have quicker showers and waste less water, we were initially told it could take two years to develop. Our amazing R&D teams had it in 11 months. We started small but when what we’re doing becomes something of a benchmark for Unilever as a whole, that’s when we can really see how big our impact can be.
Sonika: From a more personal point of view, working on Love Beauty and Planet has helped me find my purpose. Until I helped to found this brand, I hadn’t realised how much the planet and caring for our environment really affected me. Now it’s absolutely central to the way I live every day. I couldn’t be more thankful for that.
We started small. But when what we’re doing becomes something of a benchmark for Unilever as a whole, that’s when we see how big our impact can be. Piyush Jain, Global Brand Vice President for Dove, Lux Hair and Love Beauty and Planet 
Piyush: We’ve certainly come a long way – but there’s a lot we’re still working on and we’re holding ourselves to account. We’ve shared some of the highlights in Our Approach to Sustainability, our first impact report, which reflects on the brand’s first two years.
Sonika: We know how important transparency is to our consumers. That’s why we are sharing so much – to keep us honest, open and on the right track. We learned what a huge task sustainability reporting is! We’ve worked towards calculating the impact of every bottle on these pages. It’s a bank of knowledge, but it shows how we’ve put our purpose into action in a very scientific way.
Piyush: Looking ahead, we’re looking forward to growing the brand and growing the positive impact we can make.
Sonika: I’m also excited about some recent work we’ve done in the US, that will shape our mission moving forward. As a brand committed to helping make the planet cleaner, greener and more beautiful, we believe that the wellbeing of our planet starts with the wellbeing of everyone on it.
In our efforts to make the biggest impact on our communities, it's clear that not all are affected by climate change in the same way. We know that climate change has a disproportionate effect on Black and marginalised communities. That’s why we’re proud to support the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program, donating $100,000 from our carbon tax programme to facilitate change.
In addition, we’ve just launched our Love Beauty and Planet Project, a grants initiative (funded through our carbon tax programme) awarding up to $100,000 to people and their projects that aim to improve the wellbeing and health of our planet and everyone on it.
Grants will be prioritised for projects seeking to reduce carbon emissions, starting with the communities that need our help most. We cannot achieve social justice without climate justice and that’s why we’re committed to empowering changemakers to join us in making the planet cleaner, greener and more just.
Our reach is getting bigger all the time. It’s wonderful to be able to use our scale and our platform to give much more love back to the planet.

text A year ago, we pledged that by 2025 we would halve the use of virgin plastic in our packaging and remove more than 100,000 tonnes of plastic entirely.
“Throwaway culture and business models continue to dominate our lives and damage our planet,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope.
“Despite challenging conditions, we must not turn our backs on plastic pollution. It is vital for us, and for the rest of the industry, to stay the course, cut the amount of plastic we use and rapidly transition to a circular economy.”
Despite challenging conditions, we must not turn our backs on plastic pollution.
Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever
Of course, 2020 has been a year quite unlike any other. But one thing that hasn’t changed is our focus on meeting the goals we set. And we’re pleased to report that we’re on track to deliver on our promises.
Post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) now accounts for more than 10% of Unilever’s plastics footprint. This represents a significant increase from 2019 and is solid progress towards our goal of using at least 25% PCR by 2025. We also expect our use of PCR to double in the next 12 months.
We are using alternative materials to plastic where appropriate, such as our new recyclable paper-based ice cream tubs, which will save about 4,500 tonnes of plastic.
We continue to test new business models for refillable and reusable packaging. We have appointed dedicated teams to accelerate work in this space, and we’re sharing our findings publicly.
And we have developed country-specific plans to achieve our goal of collecting and processing more plastic packaging than we sell.
Less plastic. Better plastic. No plastic
Our plans to cut plastic waste are underpinned by a clear framework: we’ll use less plastic, better plastic and no plastic at all.
Our ‘less plastic’ projects include smaller packs that, when diluted with water, deliver just the same big results as standard sizes. Among them are ultra-concentrated laundry detergent packs from Comfort that have a smaller dosage than any other product on the market. We’ve also launched concentrated shampoos and conditioners from Love Beauty and Planet which provide the same number of uses, and half the usual amount of plastic.
Our work to use ‘better plastic’ includes Dove’s move to 100% recycled bottles across Europe and North America. OMO (Persil) has launched 100% recyclable, 50% PCR bottles of laundry liquid, boosted with plant-based stain remover – an innovation that’s part of our Clean Future initiative to reduce the carbon footprint of cleaning and laundry brands. Meanwhile, Magnum is introducing 7 million ice cream tubs made from food-grade recycled plastic.
Our ‘no plastic’ initiatives are gathering pace, too. Home care brand Seventh Generation has launched a zero-plastic range sold in cardboard shell packs. Tea brand PG Tips has launched biodegradable teabags and will be completely plastic-free by 2021. And in Chile, we have launched a successful pilot programme in partnership with sustainability start-up Algramo, allowing consumers to order refills of our home care brands via an app and have them delivered to their home by tricycle.
Collecting and processing plastic
We’re also working to reduce plastic pollution by helping to collect and process plastic packaging.
We’re working with partners in multiple countries to do so. This includes direct investments and partnerships in waste collection and processing, building capacity by buying recycled plastics, and supporting extended producer-responsibility schemes in which we directly pay for the collection of our packaging.
In India, for example, we are working with the United Nations Development Programme to protect the livelihoods of informal waste collectors, who help segregate, collect and recycle packaging. The partnership has reached more than 33,000 households and collected 2,500 tonnes of plastic waste so far, and will scale up to include more households in the coming years.
Meanwhile, in Indonesia, we have supported communities in 18 cities to develop systems where they can collect and sell waste. We’re using a platform called ‘Google My Business’, which enables consumers to access the locations of nearby waste banks via Google Maps. Currently, 289 waste banks are searchable on the digital tool, and the aim is to make 2,000 waste banks available through Google Maps by the end of 2020.
Taking steps towards a refill–reuse revolution
As part of today’s update, we’re sharing our learnings on refill–reuse models for the first time. Further innovations include OMO concentrates, which saw 30% of OMO 3l bottle consumers in Brazil switch to a refillable format, and Cif’s Ecorefills which have saved 171 tonnes of plastic, and are now going global.
We’ve trialled and tested several different refill–reuse methods in the past year, and it’s clear there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. We favour simple systems that minimise barriers to entry and limit the behaviour changes consumers need to adopt. Our pilots will help us identify and scale solutions that work best.
We’ve consolidated our research, pilot projects, successes and lessons learnt, and we’re bringing it all together in a dedicated page here on Unilever.com.
“To tackle the root causes of plastic waste we need to think differently about packaging. We need bold innovations that challenge existing designs, materials and business models. Our priority is to fundamentally rethink our approach to packaging, and pave the way for new solutions such as reusable and refillable formats,” explains Richard Slater, Unilever’s Chief R&D Officer.
“By adopting a ‘test, learn and refine’ mentality, we’ve developed innovative solutions that will help people cut their use of plastic for good.”
“It’s still early days. But by making refill and reuse formats more widely available, accessible, and affordable, we hope to use our scale and reach to drive lasting change.”
We’re sharing what we’ve learnt from our pilot projects to help accelerate progress and reduce plastic from our business and beyond.
text To help tackle the world's big social, environmental and economic issues, we must go beyond what we can achieve in our own operations and with our suppliers.
One way we’re extending our reach is through TRANSFORM, an initiative that brings together business, government and civil society, to leverage their respective strengths.
We set up TRANSFORM in 2015 – with the UK’s Department for International Development – to support innovative social enterprises that meet the needs of low-income households in developing countries.
By offering financial and business support to these social enterprises, TRANSFORM aims to enable up to 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia access products and services that improve their health, livelihoods, environment or wellbeing by 2025.
TRANSFORM is currently supporting over 45 projects across 11 countries, which have reached more than a million people so far.
And now, with the world-class capabilities and reach of two additional organisations – EY and Mastercard – we can do even more.
EY has joined to further its long-standing commitment to impact entrepreneurs and to help their businesses scale equitable access to vital goods and services.
Mastercard brings its network, digital technology and expertise to advance commercially sustainable impact and to put more people on a path from poverty to prosperity.
Additional capabilities already making their mark
Our support to Every1Mobile is a good example of where these additional capabilities are already making their mark.
With TRANSFORM’s support, Every1Mobile created its U Join digital platform, which helps duka owners in Kenya build business skills that will allow them to promote and expand their offering better. A ‘duka’ is a small general store that serves a local community, usually owned and run by a single person or family. They are essential components of last-mile delivery: responsible for 80% of consumer goods sales. Unilever currently trades with over 60,000 dukas.
With additional TRANSFORM funding, Every1Mobile launched an e-learning project to develop duka owners’ financial literacy in partnership with Mastercard’s Jaza Duka programme, which provides access to credit for low-income retailers. Based on content provided by Mastercard, the project delivered courses and tools to U Join and Jaza Duka shopkeepers to test whether increased knowledge about financial concepts resulted in greater uptake of Jaza Duka credit. It had a very positive impact on shopkeepers’ knowledge, use and confidence of financial concepts, digital solutions and credit.
As well as U Join, which targets informal FMCG shopkeepers in Kenya, Every1Mobile has also set up NaijaCare, a similar platform aimed at informal pharmacies in Nigeria. TRANSFORM supports both projects. The potential for these platforms is huge. Leveraging the expertise of EY, business modelling estimates that together they could be worth $43 million by 2023, based on reaching 8 million consumers across 11 cities.
“Some of the best ideas and boldest actions are coming from entrepreneurs and start-ups,” says Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Rebecca Marmot. “These disruptors are driving innovations and new business models to create the momentum the economy needs. TRANSFORM can unlock these opportunities and help to scale workable solutions, to build a brighter future for all.”
TRANSFORM brings together the public and private sectors to address the world’s most pressing development challenges
text We’re on a longstanding mission to drive gender equality in the workplace, and with 50% of managerial roles across Unilever’s global business now represented by women, we’re making positive progress.
This 50/50 split is a result that delivers on a goal we set back in 2010, at which point women accounted for 38% of our managerial roles. Since then we’ve introduced a series of programmes, partnerships and policies – all designed to support women within the company and break down any barriers to their recruitment, retention and development.
“Diversity & Inclusion is one of the three things that we want Unilever to be famous for,” says CEO Alan Jope. “This means making sure our business is fair, attracting and retaining the very best talent and helping them unlock their full potential.”
Here are nine changes we’ve made to create a more balanced business
1. We’re leading change from the top
CEO Alan Jope chairs Unilever’s Global Diversity Board. The group comprises senior leaders from across Unilever and is accountable for setting our Diversity & Inclusion strategy, giving direction and acting as a catalyst for action.
Members of the Global Diversity Board are tasked with driving gender balance within their parts of the business – and their results depend on it. Improving gender representation is written into their annual business and development targets.
We also have a network of D&I Champions: nearly 100 employees who help power this agenda through collaboration worldwide.
2. We’re improving numbers and culture at the same time
When we first started working towards our ambitions of a more gender-balanced business, the prevailing wisdom was that a culture shift had to be in place before the numbers could change.
Recognising the deep connection between an inclusive culture and a thriving workforce, we decided to take a more holistic approach. While working on cultural changes, we also applied data on current and historical challenges to set stretching targets for every market and function within Unilever.
The Unilever Leadership Executive checks progress against these targets every month, and our Global Diversity Board reviews updates three times a year to ensure we stay on track.
3. We’re unstereotyping our business as well as our brands
In 2016 we launched a global commitment to move our advertising away from stereotypes, recognising that they’re often outdated, unhelpful and, in some cases, harmful.
We turned the lens inward to our business too, commissioning a study to understand how stereotypes affected 8,000 of our employees. The results made tough reading – 60% of women and 49% of men said they felt stereotypes had held them back at work.
We took swift action, and Unstereotype the Workplace is now a global theme across Unilever for all our work to shatter limiting norms.
4. We’re addressing unconscious bias
In 2018 we began a partnership with Professor Iris Bohnet of Harvard University, which set out to put Unilever at the cutting edge of results-driven, scientific approaches to tackle unconscious bias.
With Professor Bohnet’s guidance, we introduced a metric called the Gender Appointment Ratio, which looked at the recruitment track records of some of our senior leaders over a five-year period, measuring how many men they had hired compared with the number of women.
Presenting line managers with the big picture of their recruitment decisions improves their awareness, triggers conversations around the issue, and helps them make unbiased choices next time the opportunity arises.
5. We’re offering better support for new parents – globally
In 2018 we completed the roll-out of our Global Maternal Wellbeing standard, which guarantees employees 16 weeks’ paid maternity leave, wherever they’re based. In 54% of countries, that meant going beyond regulatory requirements.
And because we recognise the valuable role of men as care-givers too, the same year we also launched our Global Paternity Leave standard. It enables new fathers to take three weeks’ paid paternity leave and is available to same-sex couples and those who choose to adopt.
6. We’re making flexible working work
All employees are entitled to request flexible working, and it’s something we’re promoting throughout the business to give people more control over how, when and where they work.
Our first job share at vice president level is proving a success, both for the business and for the women who share the role, giving them space to balance their careers with their personal purpose and responsibilities. Between them, Shelagh Muir and Jane Maciver share the role of VP R&D Strategy, Portfolio & Operations. They work three days per week each, leading a team of people based in multiple global locations.
“Our experience with job sharing has been a win–win situation for us personally and career-wise,” says Shelagh. “Two engaged, enthusiastic brains genuinely bring value to the business, and on my off-day I have space to live my purpose, working for a charity which helps people with mental health problems too.”
7. We’re tackling tricky hot spots
In 2017, we identified the areas within Unilever facing the greatest challenges in terms of achieving a gender-balanced workforce. We’ve since delved deeper to add granularity to our data, so we can refine how these historically male-dominated functions or markets can make changes.
In Supply Chain, for example, we have started to increase representation of women in the function by accelerating the development of existing female leaders and working with recruitment specialists to build proactive talent pipelines. We’ve also established a Supply Chain female mentoring programme.
Meanwhile in Finance we have adopted a performance management framework for gender representation, adding targets for directors to take leadership on creating more diverse teams.
8. We’re seeing a shift in senior roles
In Supply Chain, one of our ‘hot spots’ for gender balance, policies to support balanced internal promotions and external hiring, and unbiased assessments for senior leadership roles have made a big impact.
Female representation in vice president positions improved from 17% in December 2015 to 30% in December 2018.
We’ve also made some encouraging progress in leadership roles at our factories – traditionally a very male-dominated sector. We moved from 11% female factory leaders in 2015 to 20% in 2018. And at our tea plantations, 30% of leadership roles are now held by women.
9. We know we’ve still got work to do
We’re delighted to have reached a 50/50 gender balance in managerial roles worldwide. But we want our business to grow, and we firmly believe that empowering women and unlocking their potential is part of how we’ll achieve sustainable, equitable growth.
“Today, we’ve succeeded in reaching gender balance at management level, but our work doesn't stop there, and we will continue to be a driving force in closing the gender gap everywhere,” says Chief HR Officer Leena Nair.
“A thriving society is one where women have equal access to rights, skills and opportunities. If half the population are being held back, how are we all going to be able to move forward?” Leena adds.
Our work to achieve gender balance in managerial roles was recognised with a prestigious award in January.

text Most cleaning products on the market today are made using chemicals derived from fossil fuels. It’s been that way for decades.
But we had a thought.
There are many sources of carbon already on and above the ground – like plants, plastic waste and even the carbon dioxide in the air. If we could harness those sustainably, at a big enough scale, we wouldn’t have to take carbon from non-renewable sources under the ground.
That way, we will eliminate our use of virgin fossil fuels in our cleaning and laundry formulations. Better for the planet. Better for consumers. And better for our business.
Well, we’ve come up with a way to do just that.
Transforming the sustainability of global brands
‘Clean Future’ is a ground-breaking innovation strategy designed to fundamentally change the way that our cleaning and laundry products are created, manufactured and packaged.
It is unique in its ambition to embed circular economy principles into both packaging and formulations. That means reduce-reuse-recycle, rather than take-make-dispose.
At the heart of this strategy is a new ambition: to replace 100% of the carbon derived from fossil fuels in Unilever’s cleaning and laundry product formulations with renewable or recycled carbon by 2030.
Clean Future will transform the sustainability of global brands like OMO (Persil), Sunlight, Cif and Domestos. It’s also a big step towards our pledge of net zero emissions from our products by 2039.
Clean Future is our vision to radically overhaul our business. As an industry, we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material in products. Peter ter Kulve, Home Care President 
A radical overhaul of our business
The chemicals used in our cleaning and laundry products currently make up the greatest proportion of their carbon footprint across their lifecycle. By moving to renewable or recycled ingredient sources in their formulations, we will unlock novel ways to reduce that carbon footprint.
“Clean Future is our vision to radically overhaul our business,” says Peter ter Kulve, President of our Home Care division. “As an industry, we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material for our products. We must stop pumping carbon from under the ground when there is ample carbon on and above the ground – if we can learn to utilise it at scale.
“We’ve seen unprecedented demand for our cleaning products in recent months and we are incredibly proud to play our part helping to keep people safe in the fight against Covid-19. But that should not be a reason for complacency. We cannot let ourselves become distracted from the environmental crises that our world – our home – is facing. Pollution. Destruction of natural habitats. The climate emergency. This is the home we share and we have a responsibility to protect it.”
Superior, affordable, greener
We have ringfenced €1 billion for our Clean Future strategy, which is in addition to our new €1 billion Climate & Nature Fund. This will finance biotechnology research, CO2 utilisation, low carbon chemistry, biodegradable and water-efficient formulations, and reducing the use of virgin plastic.
Essentially, we will use it to create affordable products that deliver the unbeatable clean people expect from our products, combined with a significantly lower environmental impact.
In fact, our Clean Future strategy is already supporting industry-leading projects around the world.
For instance, soda ash is a key ingredient in laundry detergents, but it’s currently made using a lot of energy from fossil fuels. That’s why we’ve partnered with Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals (TAC) in southern India and Carbon Clean Solutions (CCSL). They have pioneered a cutting-edge method to capture CO2 from their own production processes before it reaches the atmosphere, and use the captured CO2 as a raw material to make their soda ash.
In Slovakia, we’re partnering with biotech leader Evonik Industries to develop rhamnolipids, a renewable and biodegradable surfactant which is already used in our Sunlight (Quix) dishwashing liquid in Chile and Vietnam. We hope to significantly scale and build from both technologies.
Unilever's commitment to shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable resources, combined with strong sustainable sourcing, has real potential to make an important contribution to an economy that works with nature, not against it Tanya Steele, Chief Executive WWF UK 
Rewriting the rule book
As we pave the way to decarbonise our formulations, we must diversify the carbon sources we use.
We call this the Carbon Rainbow™.
We will replace non-renewable sources (black carbon) with captured CO2 (purple), plants and biological (green), marine algae (blue) and carbon recovered from waste material like plastic (grey).
Putting carbon diversity at the core of our Clean Future strategy is essential. This new way of sourcing carbon will be guided by environmental impact assessments and work alongside our industry-leading sustainable sourcing programmes to prevent unintended pressures on ecosystems.
People want affordable, sustainable products that are just as good as conventional ones. Rapid developments in science and technology are allowing us to offer these, with the promise of exciting new benefits, from ultra-mild ingredients to self-cleaning clothes and surfaces.
“A new bio and circular economy is rising from the ashes of fossil fuels and it is rewriting the rule book of our industry,” says Peter. “Diversifying sources of carbon is essential to grow within the limits of our planet. By sharing our Carbon Rainbow model, we are calling on an economy-wide transformation in how we all use carbon.”

text Every year, we recognise pioneering individuals within the company who have brought our values to life and truly embody what it means to be part of Unilever. Our 2019 Heroes with Impact have gone above and beyond their day-to-day jobs. Their stories paint a picture of passion, purpose and drive.
Only 16% of young people in Brazil go on to university, according to the OECD – a figure below some of its South American neighbours.
And at university girls are under-represented in science and maths. Felipe Resck, Go to Market Technology Manager, Brazil, recalls his own education. “In the university where I graduated, there was were 80 people [in my class],” he says. “Out of the 80 people, only seven were girls.”
Better job prospects come with education, and girls from deprived communities are generally at a disadvantage as they take their place in the workforce.
Bringing ‘iamtheCODE’ to Brazil
Felipe realised he had a part to play to redress the balance. His involvement stemmed from conversations with Mariéme Jamme, founder of the global movement, ‘iamtheCODE’, which teaches girls coding and other work-related skills. Felipe linked up with Mariéme at a hackathon event in Recife – developed with the aim of evaluating local skills – and was inspired to take a stand and work towards a more inclusive workplace in his own country.
‘IamtheCODE’ was set up to achieve four of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including quality education, gender equality, decent work and innovation. It has declared the impressive ambition of reaching more than 1 million girls with training and mentoring by 2030. The movement had already run educational projects in a number of countries, notably in Africa, but this was a first in Brazil.
Felipe took a pioneering role. He brought Unilever personal care brand Sedel (Sunsilk) on board. With its purpose of opening up possibilities for girls everywhere, Sedel provided an excellent fit with the initiative. Local NGO Plano de Menina, Sedel’s existing partner, also joined the project. Contact was made with a secondary school in São Paulo and Felipe worked with them to ensure that the content of the ‘iamtheCODE’ classes aligned with the Brazilian educational system.
And so the São Paulo Digital Club was set up. The girls who enrolled were taught about coding. “We teach girls the basics of programming logic,” explains Felipe. “And then we show, in real life, how to code.” But the classes covered much more than that.
“The core of the programme is about empowerment,” he adds.
The classes included elements of confidence-building and other soft skills, and harnessed non-traditional techniques such as acting to facilitate learning. The girls were even encouraged to debate the Sustainable Development Goals.
Forty volunteers, drawn from Unilever and the community, helped Felipe in rolling out the project. Over three months he managed the teams of volunteers and ensured that the course content was correctly followed. The students were well supported and no one got left behind.
This holistic approach helped the girls to prepare themselves to join the workforce or undertake further education.
“This is perhaps one of their first opportunities to have a better job,” says Felipe, who participated in every class. “It’s changing not only the lives of the girls but also the lives of the volunteers.”
Early results
In all, 90 girls took part in the activities in São Paulo and Recife. Felipe liaised with his Unilever HR team about recruiting some of ‘iamtheCODE’ participants as apprentices and one of the girls has since been hired.
And now plans are being made to scale up the project, with mayoral support in two cities and three more companies willing to join the movement. More than 200 girls are on the waiting list for the next round.
Felipe is conscious of the need to give back to society. “I am where I am because other people helped me,” he says. “There is a moment in life where you should be returning that back to society.”
text Looking back over the past two years, what do you regard as the greatest success for The Vegetarian Butcher?
There have been many successes, but the most exciting one for me has been that we have succeeded in transitioning The Vegetarian Butcher from being a local brand to being a global one. I am very proud that the original ‘Butchers’ and the new Unilever team have become one unified team, and that we have been able to retain the rebellious nature of the brand, while opening up many new markets. Our products are now sold in over 20,000 retail outlets in 30 different countries.
And the greatest challenge? How have you dealt with it?
Speed. We have had to move with lightning speed to make sure we stay ahead of the troops in this food revolution. For example, when we pitched for Burger King’s Plant-based Whopper, we were given the chance to access a platform where we could reach meat-lovers in 25 markets and offer them a delicious, plant-based alternative to the meat-based original. However, we only had six months to go from idea to launch.
We made it happen through great teamwork and by being agile, entrepreneurial and decisive. When we had setbacks, we just kept our purpose in view, and focused on the long game of changing an entire industry. In the end, we launched the Plant-based Whopper, on time, simultaneously in 25 markets.
Have there been any surprises along the way?
In a newly developing industry like ours… there are daily surprises! Most recently, the European Parliament voted on potentially banning the use of names like ‘burger’, ‘sausage’ and ‘steak’ to describe plant-based products. A ban on these words would have severely limited how we named and marketed our products. It would also have been a blow to improving sustainability for the planet, as the proposed restrictions would have directly contradicted the EU’s objectives to create a healthier and more sustainable food system, as stated in the European Green Deal and the Farm to Fork strategy.
We energetically opposed the ban through our ‘I am not confused’ Instagram petition, which we then expanded to a real-world outdoor campaign on voting day in Brussels. We were thrilled that the ban was rejected. It marked an important step for the plant-based food revolution.
Looking forward, what are your ambitions for The Vegetarian Butcher in the years to come?
Our ambition is be the leader in plant-based meat, and to step up our global impact by making The Vegetarian Butcher the biggest butcher in the world. All our products reflect our ‘Sacrifice Nothing’ motto. It has been our philosophy for the past decade and it is something we are very much looking forward to continuing in the future. We have our eyes on many more markets and are excited about the new range of innovative products we have in the pipeline (if you want to stay up to date, follow us on social media – @ thevegetarianbutcher #thevegetarianbutcher).
Finally, what is your signature Vegetarian Butcher ‘meat’ dish?
I love cooking, and my favorite dishes within our range are the Indian-style curries. Our vegan Chicken Chunks are amazing. They are really tender and absorb all the flavour of the curry. As cooks, I really think we need to move away from thinking ‘is this as good as meat?’. This dish is the one that makes me think ‘this is better than meat’!
Explore some of The Vegetarian Butcher milestones from the last two years
December 2018 – The Vegetarian Butcher joins the Unilever family
Although Unilever and The Vegetarian Butcher had been working together on specific projects since 2016, the acquisition was a turning point for both businesses. For Unilever, it marked a milestone in its commitment to growing its plant-based portfolio, while for the founder of The Vegetarian Butcher, Jaap Korteweg, it marked the next step in achieving his ambition to conquer the world. “Unilever’s international network across 190 countries provides every opportunity to accomplish this,” he said at the time.
November 2019 – Plant-based Fast Food
Launched in 2,500 Burger King restaurants across 25 European countries, the concept of the Plant-based Whopper was born from the need to satisfy the increasing number of people shifting to a flexitarian diet and requesting plant-based food.
March 2020 – Award-winning Changemaker
The Vegetarian Butcher was named Marketing Transformer of the Year at the Dutch Marketing Awards. The jury report stated: “In just one year The Vegetarian Butcher has transformed into a global leader in plant-based meat, truly unleashing a world food revolution. Purpose at the very core.”

June 2020 – Praised by PETA in Germany
Chickened Out Burger was awarded the best chicken alternative on the German market by animal rights organisation PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). It praised the fact that the product not only looked like chicken but tasted like it as well.
September 2020 – Big in Hong Kong
The Vegetarian Butcher made its Asian debut in Hong Kong, launching its Spanish NoMeatballs and sautéed NoWagyu beef with black pepper sauce in seven restaurants in the region. The launch offered Hong Kong foodies their first taste of The Vegetarian Butcher’s plant-based meat and took the brand one step closer to achieving its ambition of becoming the biggest butcher in the world.
September 2020 – Nuggets of success
Following the success of the Plant-based Whopper, Burger King and The Vegetarian Butcher joined forces again to create their ground-breaking plant-based chicken nuggets. Crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside, they proved to be just as dippable as their chicken counterparts – complete with their own trio of sauces.
October 2020 – Converting meat-lovers in Brazil
October saw Latin America getting its first taste of The Vegetarian Butcher’s plant-based meat, when establishments in Brazil’s culinary capitals, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo incorporated it into various dishes on their menus. In a country renowned for its love of meat, this marks a milestone in the food revolution.
October 2020 – #Schnitzelgate
When an amendment was presented to the European Parliament suggesting that vegetarian products should be banned from using names traditionally used for meat – such as sausage or burger – The Vegetarian Butcher launched the ‘We are not confused’ campaign. The #SchnitzelGate visual petition got incredible support on social media, and thankfully most MEPs agreed, giving the Food Revolution a new win.
text To celebrate our 90th birthday and help us look ahead to the next 90 years, we asked leading sustainability, purpose and business influencers to share their thoughts on how companies with purpose will be successful in the future.
Here’s what Piyush Pandey, Ogilvy’s Chief Creative Officer Worldwide and Executive Chairman India, had to say.
text We’ve pledged to halve our use of virgin plastic by 2025 – partly by eliminating over 100,000 tonnes of plastic from our packaging – and to design all our packaging to be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable.
We’re making good progress towards these targets, but we’re increasingly asked why we don’t just stop using plastic altogether. And there are good reasons why not.
Plastic has a place in the economy and in business, as it’s crucial for the safe and efficient distribution of products. It also often has the lowest carbon footprint compared to other materials.
Our approach to products and packaging is changing
Science tells us that most of the solutions we need already exist today, but we must fix the broken plastic system to protect our ocean and marine ecosystems. We need new ways for consumers to easily access everyday products with less plastic waste as a result. We want to keep plastic in a circular loop system by collecting, processing and repeatedly reusing it.
So we’re rethinking how we design products, developing whole new business models and offering different shopping experiences for our consumers. This includes looking at alternative options to plastic – such as metal, paper and glass – provided these don’t create an environmental problem elsewhere. Plastic-free packaging innovations are another solution, these include bamboo toothbrushes from Signal and recyclable glass soup bottles from Knorr.
We’re using reuse-refill solutions to cut out new plastic completely too. In Chile, we have partnered with social enterprise Algramo to deliver a refill model directly to consumers at home. In the UK, we launched our biggest refill trial to date in Europe, in partnership with retailer Asda and sustainability experts Beauty Kitchen.
Of course, the more others come on board (businesses and governments especially) and work to tackle this together, the bigger the impact we can have.

text Southern Brazil, an area fondly known as the breadbasket of the world, is also the location of our Pouso Alegre site where 1,100 employees manufacture some of Unilever’s leading food brands.
As well as manufacturing Hellmann’s and Knorr products, the factory has production lines for Arisco broths, Mae Terra, one of the Brazil’s best-known brands for natural and organic goods, and plant-based beverage AdeS for Coca-Cola.
Some 80% of the factory’s waste is mineral-rich, plant-based, recyclable organic matter, explains Environment Coordinator Rodrigo Cano. But he and his team were focused on ways to achieve zero organic waste disposal and started to brainstorm ideas around circular economy. “We liked the idea of reusing waste,” he says.
Food for thought
When you work in a factory manufacturing food, quality raw ingredients are always front of mind. “Our organic waste contains all you need to create a great compost. The idea of having our own kitchen garden that everyone in the factory could use grew from there,” he adds.
A south-facing green space was found in factory grounds and an external company was contracted to build some greenhouses and a recycling area. “Where possible we reused materials in their construction too,” says Rodrigo. “We used recycled tetra pack tiles to make the roof.”
Five people were assigned to the gardening team. “Severino, one of our ops managers, was blessed with green fingers and became head gardener,” says Rodrigo. All five are responsible for caring for the crops and deciding what seasonal varieties to grow.
Giving nature a helping hand
The garden’s secret ingredient is the compost made from factory waste which provides quality soil and natural pest control. “It normally takes 120 days to create compost from organic matter,” says Rodrigo. “We had tech on the site to reduce the time needed to ten days. We simply put everything in a mixer and use peat and calcium hydroxide to accelerate the exothermic reaction and incorporate beneficial bacteria.”
The greenhouses and their raised plant beds were completed on a glorious sunny day. Fittingly, salad leaves were chosen as their first crop. “We made planting into a family day. It was a lovely to see how much fun some of the kids had digging the soil and getting their hands dirty,” Rodrigo says.
Today 90% of the garden’s harvest is used in the factory’s cafeteria and 10% is given to a local community care home that looks after 80 senior residents and a nursery which educates 217 local children. Factory staff are also free to take lettuce home for their own use.
Having access to fresh produce grown on site, has an impact on staff eating habits. “We eat better, we eat together,” Rodrigo explains. “Next year we are hosting four workshops with Knorr, looking at nutrition and healthier options.”
Knorr’s work looking at Future Foods and raising awareness of plant-based crops means that beets, spinach and purple cabbage may soon be grown in the factory’s greenhouses. There are plans for a community garden that local groups can use and there’s potential to sell on factory compost commercially.
Achieving zero waste and additional revenue opportunities provide the factory with strong commercial benefits. “But for me, this project is more than a way to achieve a KPI,” says Rodrigo. “It’s a new way to look at our manufacturing processes so that something good comes from every part of the process.”
text Earlier this year, we launched the 
world’s first laundry capsule
made using captured carbon emissions – or recycled carbon. Now, we’re piloting this world-class innovation in two more brands around the world.
Sunlight in South Africa launched the world’s first hand-dishwash made using recycled carbon in its formulation. And more recently, in Germany, we have also launched our first laundry liquid in which the key cleaning ingredient is made with recycled carbon too. The limited-edition Coral Optimal Color+ featured our first label on-pack to promote recycled carbon within a product, including a QR code that helps consumers find out more about recycled carbon and the brand’s sustainability journey. The product is also packaged in recyclable bottles made using 70% recycled plastic, meaning washing your clothes just got cleaner .
Andreea Sapunaru, Global Marketing Director Fabric, Cleaning, said of the launch, “We undertook a full product development for the launch in Germany – not only in changing the formulation, but the packaging too. It’s a market in which we see high consumer sentiment for more sustainable solutions and so we’re delighted to have launched this as a first step in our journey to a Clean Future.”
Creating a carbon shift
The chemical industry is the backbone to modern manufacturing, but it is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which provide 85% of the feedstock or raw fuel it uses. * You can’t make cleaning products without chemicals, but you can make chemicals without fossil fuels.
That’s why we’ve committed to eliminating virgin petrochemicals from our cleaning and laundry formulations. As part of Clean Future strategy, Unilever developed the ‘Carbon Rainbow’ to help illustrate how we’re working to shift the carbon inputs used in our products to renewable and recycled sources.
We are working to replace non-renewable virgin fossil fuels, also known as ‘black’ carbon, with other renewable and recycled carbon sources. These include ‘purple’ carbon captured from the air or from industrial emissions, ‘blue’ carbon from sources in the ocean, ‘grey’ carbon from waste materials and ‘green’ carbon from plants and biomass.
Creating a cleaner future
Working with our partners LanzaTech and India Glycols Limited (IGL), carbon recycling processes are used to trap industrial emissions from a steel plant before they enter the atmosphere. The captured gases are added to various bacterial cultures (a bit like yeast) to convert them into ethanol. This is then used to produce surfactants – a key cleaning ingredient that creates foam and breaks down oil, grease and soil. Surfactants are typically made directly from fossil fuels, making them one of the most greenhouse gas intensive ingredients in our products, so being able to create them using recycled carbon is a big environmental win.
Jon Hague, our VP for Science and Technology, who leads the Clean Future programme, says: “Our partnership with LanzaTech and IGL has enabled us to use a world-first innovation in the cleaning industry and trial it across different brands, products and markets. Our journey to a Clean Future is well underway and how we bring this to life for consumers in our products and on-pack is key to helping them make more informed purchasing choices that are better for them and the planet.”
text Having never manufactured hand sanitiser at our Leeds factory before, we were pleased, on 2 April, to be able to supply our first batch of more than 700 litres to St James’s University Hospital, part of the Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. Our aim is to donate further product to support the local NHS in the coming weeks.
It’s thanks to the efforts of employees from across Unilever and the rapid response of our suppliers – with materials, packaging and labels – that we have been able to scale up production of the hand sanitiser from laboratory trials to factory production in just four days.
“This has been a massive collective effort by teams within our business and our suppliers, while many are remote working,” says Jason Sutcliffe, Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care Supply Chain Manager who has been leading this initiative. “We have all wanted to get involved so we can do our bit to help those on the frontline. We’re just pleased we’re able to contribute in this way.”
Team effort by employees, suppliers and partners
With stringent health and safety requirements around the use of ethanol (alcohol) – the main ingredient in hand sanitiser – our Leeds factory was well-placed to start producing supplies quickly, as ethanol is already used in some of the products manufactured at the site.
As well as working on the formulation of the product, we needed to check that all the necessary safety measures were in place and to sanitise the equipment. We then had to source the raw materials and packaging, with some ingredients already on-site and others coming from Unilever facilities elsewhere in the UK and Europe, as well as from third-party suppliers. More than 10,000 bulk containers were shipped to us by our suppliers within just hours of requesting them.
In order to ensure we could make an effective product, and to identify any potential issues, we made a small trial batch in our on-site pilot plant. Experts from across our business were called on to advise on all aspects of producing the hand sanitiser from hygiene regulations, to quality control, to transport safety.
Our design agency and label supplier went over and above to provide labelling, with the necessary regulatory information included to ensure compliance and traceability, in just over a day.
Jon Strachan, VP Supply Chain, Unilever UK & Ireland, says: “With hand sanitiser in short supply and much needed to help protect NHS staff in the fight against coronavirus, we’re pleased to have been able to switch over some of our production at our Leeds deodorant factory to make it there.
“I want to thank our factory team – who pulled out all the stops to get the production up and running – as well as a number of our supply, engineering and logistics partners who have supported us generously and at speed, for making this possible.”

Here’s what Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart, had to say.
text About the author
Owner of Thailand’s Taweekit retail chain
Tawee is the founder and owner of Thailand’s Taweekit Supercenters, a retail
chain with branches across the country. He steered the company from the brink of
collapse during the 1997 financial crisis to the success story it is today.
To celebrate our 90th birthday, and help us look ahead to the next 90 years, we asked leading sustainability, purpose and business influencers to share their thoughts on how companies with purpose will be successful in the future.
There are all sorts of reasons why a business may fail, many of which are outside its control. But of all the things it must be and do to succeed, upholding the highest standards of morals and ethics with its customers, its suppliers and itself is the bedrock. Everything else is built on that. And those standards must never be compromised, in good times or bad.
Unilever’s story is a case in point. The business was founded on a sense of purpose all those years ago. Today, the company may be considerably bigger and more diverse, but that foundation – the desire to do good for the communities it serves – is as true and strong as it ever was.
The story of my business is similar in many respects. And interestingly, it is interwoven with that of Unilever.
A means to an end
I was born into a very poor family. We lived in a rented wooden shack with an old galvanised tin roof and we had nothing. I never felt sad about being poor. What I regret is that I lost my father when I was three. I don’t remember much about him – only that he was a good and honest man.
So, along with my two brothers, I was raised by my mother. She is a strong woman and a great role model. When I was eight, I had to leave school to help her run our small store where we sold shrimp paste, fermented fish and tobacco.
Our approach was simple: good products at reasonable prices. People in our community – like us – could barely afford the necessities of life. We wanted to ease their burden, while making a small profit to keep a roof over our head and food on the table.
When I was 18, my mother asked me to take over running the store. As I grew into that role, I saw an opportunity to open branches in other communities – to create jobs and generate income. If people have jobs locally, they don’t have to move and be away from family. It is typical in this part of the country for young people especially to move away to find work. This just compounds the problem.
Steady growth by remaining true to our roots
I’m not well educated, but I have always liked to read. When I was a kid, I remember reading that in other countries, they had things called department stores. There was nothing like that in North East Thailand so I dreamed that, one day, I would build the first.
Over time, I gradually turned our grocery store into a small shopping mall, selling a wider range of products including clothes. In 1961, with the store doing well, we moved to new, larger premises. And about ten years later, the time was right to build my first department store. Being a frugal person at heart, I only did this when I could afford to without a bank loan. We opened that one in 1974.
People doubted it would work, because we offered products at such low prices. But we stayed true to our roots and it proved popular. So much so, after about four years, we expanded the store. And over the next 15 years, we opened branches in new areas.
On the brink of collapse
But luck was not on my side. In July 1997, shortly after we had opened our latest superstore, the Asia region was plunged into financial crisis and Thailand was badly hit. The currency collapsed, the government raised interest rates and over 50 major financial institutions were forced to close.
At the time, most of our company’s money was held in one of those banks. I couldn’t get at any of it. As a result, many of our suppliers suspended deliveries to us. We couldn’t pay, so I don’t blame them. We had no choice but to shut down two of our stores.
But from the depths of that chaos and extreme uncertainty emerged a true friend.
In times of crisis, you find out who you can really trust
I had the idea to take the stock I already had in my stores and sell it on a market stall. Customers came and demand increased so, after a while, I decided to open the first small Taweekit store.
During this time, when other suppliers had stopped delivering to us, Unilever did the opposite – they delivered more. This allowed us to stay true to our approach of offering good products at affordable prices. Even in that time of great hardship, we never wavered from that promise to our customers.
The belief that Unilever showed in us and what we were trying to achieve – because it resonated with its own purpose – actually proved to be the turning point for our business. We re-established our cash flow, got back on track and, when the situation eventually improved, we were able to pay back all our suppliers.
We then set about building the business again, reopening the stores that we had been forced to close and re-employing people. We are due to open our 185th Taweekit branch in 2020. And we have plans for further expansion.
Bringing happiness to the community
Thanks to the 1997 financial crisis – during which it seemed like there was no way back – we now have a stronger, more robust business. If there had been no crisis, we probably wouldn’t have the 165 branches that we have today.
These days, competition is tough. Where once there were no department stores, now there are many. But this is healthy. It’s another reminder – not that we need one – to never take our customers for granted. It drives us to improve our business relentlessly and vigorously.
Our philosophy is ‘Taweekit brings savings and happiness to the community’. Even at our lowest point, when the business was all but gone, this thinking – the principles of right and wrong, and our desire to do good in the community – never strayed from the front of my mind.
We have been around for 59 years, despite – or more accurately, because of – our ups and downs. We believe we are now in good shape to be around for another 59.
text One-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. That amounts to 1.3 billion tonnes of food literally thrown away every year.
So how is it possible that so much food is lost or wasted in a world where one in nine people goes hungry or undernourished? And what can be done about it?
These are the questions that will be at the heart of discussions and events during the first UN International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste held on 29 September.
Raising awareness, committing to change
Established by the Food Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the day aims not only to raise awareness about food waste, but also to promote global efforts aimed at hitting Target 12.3 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Namely, a 50% reduction of food loss and waste by 2030.
As a member of the Champions 12.3 coalition, Unilever is dedicated to accelerating progress towards achieving this target.
To ensure that our own house is in order, we have longstanding zero waste to landfill programmes in place. Recently, we also committed to halving food loss and waste in our own global operations by 2030, in line with Target 12.3. We have also adopted the Champions 12.3 ‘Target–Measure–Act’ approach and will publicly report our food waste footprint to contribute to increased transparency around this data.
“Only if we tackle food loss and waste can we feed the world within planetary boundaries; mitigate climate change; and relieve pressure on natural resources. The bigger impact and responsibility of Unilever lies in our ability to influence our suppliers and customers to follow our lead and, particularly consumers, to waste less food,” says Hanneke Faber, President, Foods & Refreshment, Unilever.
We can only feed the world within planetary boundaries if we solve food waste. As Unilever we will inspire consumers to waste less food and work with our suppliers and customers to do the same. Hanneke Faber, Unilever President Foods & Refreshment 
Why tackling food waste matters
Food loss and waste is unseen, under-valued and a senseless misuse of human, environmental and economic capital. It consumes one-quarter of the water used for agriculture every year. It is also a major contributor to the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and is responsible for 8% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest producer of greenhouse gases.
Our brand Hellmann’s has a fundamental belief that food is too good to be wasted. With its products reaching the homes of millions of people worldwide, Hellmann’s has both an opportunity and a responsibility to raise awareness about the issue of household food waste and help people become more resourceful with their food.
“We know that our brand can make a positive change in the way our consumers use their food at home,” says Christina Bauer-Plank, Global Brand Vice President, Hellmann’s. “Hellmann’s has always helped people to turn even the simplest ingredients into tasty meals.”
An unexpected shift
With 40–45% of food waste being generated in people’s homes, it’s clear that any significant change in reducing food waste depends on changing the habits and attitudes of consumers.
Yet not many people think of themselves as major contributors to food waste. Some are not aware of the extent of the issue, while others do not recognise their own actions as being part of the problem.
However, with its lockdowns, restricted shopping and home-bound life, the Covid-19 crisis has forced people to look more closely at their food consumption. This has resulted in an unexpected shift in attitude.
While the fear of not having enough food led to some stockpiling and ultimately waste, research has shown that time spent at home made many people more appreciative of the value of food. A survey carried out by environmental agency Hubbub UK showed that 57% of respondents felt they valued food more since the pandemic.
Small changes with huge impact
With more people open to adopting less wasteful behaviours towards food, Hellmann’s is continuing to step up its efforts to both raise awareness about food waste and provide practical solutions to reduce it.
Solutions that include helping people see the potential in their perishables, nudging them to cook with the ingredients in their fridge and, perhaps most importantly, helping them gain the skills and knowledge they need to make the most of the food they already have.
Over the past two years, Hellmann’s has already reached more than 100 million people in Brazil and other countries with campaigns to transform leftovers into tasty meals. Now the brand is extending its efforts to markets in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Partnering for success
By partnering with community organisations and NGOs, Hellmann’s is not only amplifying awareness about the issue, it is also maximising the impact of its programmes, most notably those focused on redistributing surplus food.
In the US, Hellmann’s has worked with organisations such as East Side House Settlement and Farms to Food Banks to help rescue surplus food from farms and redistribute this to 200,000 households in need. Similarly, in Canada Hellmann’s Real Food Rescue programme has helped rescue over 100,000 meals to support people in need.
We don’t have to persuade people that food waste is wrong. We just have to give people tools so that they can use what they have better. Christina Bauer-Plank, Global Brand Vice President, Hellmann’s 
Unlocking the reasons for waste
However, tackling the issue of food waste must go further than finding ways to use surplus food. We also need to understand why food is wasted in the first place.
That’s why Hellmann’s is working with leading academic experts, including behavioural psychologists at BEworks, and subject specialists such as Dr Erica van Herpen at Wageningen University, to understand the psychology behind food waste, and what could positively impact behaviour.
“No one feels good about throwing good food away,” says Christina Bauer-Plank. “We don’t have to persuade people that food waste is wrong. Everyone knows that. We just have to give people tools so that they can use what they have better.”

text Julia, what’s Unilever’s stance on animal testing?
Dr Julia Fentem 
We firmly believe that animal testing is not necessary to assure the safety of our types of products (personal care, home care and foods) or the ingredients in them – for the people who use them, the people who manufacture them, or for the planet.
Advances in science and technology mean that we can generate much more relevant safety data to protect people and the environment using modern non-animal approaches relevant for the species of concern (for example humans, fish and so on). We have developed and used a wide range of non-animal methods for more than 40 years and advocate that others also ‘use science, not animals’.
We’re calling for transformative change to chemicals regulations so they are based on advanced animal-free safety science in place of outdated animal tests.
So much progress has been made in recent years to ban animal tests for cosmetics around the world. But now that progress is at risk?
That’s right. A full ban on selling cosmetics in the EU where the ingredients had been tested on animals was introduced in 2013. At Unilever, we’ve worked closely with government regulators and scientists all over the world to share our expertise in non-animal approaches for assessing ingredient safety and we support calls for a global ban. Currently, 41 countries prohibit animal testing for cosmetics.
Advances in science and technology mean that we can generate much more relevant safety data to protect people and the environment using modern non-animal approaches.
Dr Julia Fentem, Unilever
However, in 2020 a new threat emerged, which is reversing this great progress. Under the EU’s chemicals regulations, which cover workers and the environment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) began to ask for new animal tests to be carried out on chemicals which are ingredients in a wide range of consumer products with a long history of safe use and manufacture – even those solely used in cosmetics. The move is destroying the EU’s 2013 ban.
Virtually everything on the planet is comprised of chemicals. The water we drink. The air we breathe. The plants around us. And so are the ingredients in our products – even the plant-based ones. We design our products so that every ingredient included is at a level which we can show to be safe for people and the planet based on scientific evidence – and we don't need to test on animals to achieve this.
Instead, we assess the interactions of a chemical with biological pathways at relevant exposure levels using a wide range of cell-based, analytical and computational modelling tools. These provide us with data that enable us to include ingredients in our products at levels well below those which may be harmful to consumers or our environment.
So the EU’s rules banning animal testing for cosmetics and the rules governing chemicals contradict each other?
Yes they do. There are currently significant inconsistencies between the EU’s approaches for establishing the safety of products such as cosmetics and foods compared with how chemicals (some of which are used in those products) are regulated, based mostly on data from animal tests.
The EU’s REACH* regulation, which governs the production and use of chemicals, rules that animal testing should only be carried out as a last resort. This is not happening in practice due to ECHA’s requests for new animal testing. And that’s why we want policymakers to transform EU chemicals regulations so that they are based on the modern (so-called ‘next generation’) safety science that now exists.
Without change, ECHA’s approach will continue to result in needless harm to countless animals.
EU citizens, please sign to ask policy-makers to protect the ban on animal testing for cosmetics and transform EU chemicals regulation.
What action is Unilever taking to help achieve regulatory change?
Through our brands and as a global business, we’re supporting a European Citizens’ Initiative asking for the EU’s ban on animal testing of cosmetics to be upheld, and for chemicals regulations to be transformed to be based on using non-animal safety science.
We have submitted comments to recent EU Commission public consultations calling for amendments to REACH and the Cosmetics Products Regulation. We’re urging them to enable and encourage use of the latest non-animal safety science to ensure any animal testing is truly a last resort and to uphold the EU’s animal testing ban on cosmetic ingredients.
We also fully support the European Green Deal and the EU Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) ambition to better protect citizens and the environment and boost innovation for safe and sustainable chemicals. In line with the CSS strategy, we welcome the opportunity to fundamentally change the chemical assessment paradigm to ensure chemical ingredients are safe and sustainable by design. Safe for products, people and the planet.
Based on our internal Safe & Sustainable by Design approach, which has been in place for many years, we are involved with other scientists and trade associations in the development of assessment frameworks. As well as working with industry trade associations to engage directly with the EU Commission on these opportunities for a safer and more sustainable future, we are playing a lead role scientifically with organisations such as the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) ) and the Animal-Free Safety Assessment (AFSA) Collaboration to accelerate the transition to animal-free innovation using safe and sustainable ingredients.
What one change would you like to see in this space?
I would love to see the EU being bold and progressive in re-thinking its regulatory approaches to chemicals
Dr Julia Fentem, Unilever
Europe has outlined leadership ambitions for safe, sustainable innovation to rebuild trust in the safety of chemicals and there is a huge opportunity to do so using advanced science and technology, not animals, to better protect people and our planet.
I would love to see the EU being bold and progressive in re-thinking its regulatory approaches to chemicals, so they enable use of the best science available rather than continuing to be anchored in animal tests dating back many decades. 
Finally, how can people help call for regulatory change?
In Europe, an EU Citizens’ Initiative is running until 31 August. Once it reaches one million signatures, EU policymakers will have to consider its three aims: protecting the ban on animal testing for cosmetics, transforming chemicals regulations and modernising science in the EU.
If you’re an EU citizen, please visit https://eci.ec.europa.eu/019/public/ to sign. If you’re not, please help spread the word.
* REACH stands for Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. It’s a European Union regulation dating from December 2006. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.
text ​Our 400+ household-name brands and huge global reach give us a unique opportunity to create positive change in the world and to achieve our purpose of making sustainable living commonplace. As 2019 draws to a close, we thought we’d look back over the year to see how that vision has been turned into real, tangible action. So grab a cuppa and enjoy reading about a few of the many ways we made a difference.
1. We ramped up our efforts to reduce plastic waste
Plastic is crucial for the safe and efficient distribution of our products, and it has a lower carbon footprint than many alternative materials. It has its place. But that place is not littering our streets, rivers and oceans. So we upped our game, committing to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging, and collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell… all by 2025. As part of that, we’re continuing to experiment and innovate with refill and reuse solutions, and rolling out more 100% recycled packaging. Dove made a big announcement on this in October.
2. We made some big moves to help tackle the climate crisis
In September, we passed an important milestone, with all our factories, offices, R&D facilities, data centres, warehouses and distribution centres – across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America – now being powered by 100% renewable grid electricity. This marked a significant step towards our target to become a carbon neutral company before 2030. We also made progress towards our goal of cutting our logistics carbon emissions by 40% through smarter planning, alternative fuels and partnerships with tech start-ups.
3. We stood up for women’s and girl’s empowerment
Dove and UNICEF joined forces to educate 10 million more young people on self-esteem and body confidence, to help them fulfil their potential. Since its inception in 2004, the Dove Self-Esteem Project has reached over 35 million young people across 140 countries. Sunsilk has also been busy this year. Inspiring girls to dream of a future full of possibility, the brand supported the ‘Explore More’ education programme in Thailand and Pakistan, set up the ‘Together We Rock’ platform in Brazil and launched its ‘Rethink Pink’ campaign in Argentina, featuring strong female role models.
4. We used our voice to push for equality
Hindustan Unilever (HUL) joined in the country’s first Pride campaign, which included a two-month-long drive to create awareness and nudge the culture in the workplace. This campaign was part of our global push to create a truly inclusive work environment for people with diverse genders and orientations. We continued our work to make Unilever more inclusive of people with a disability. We also ran initiatives to help refugees integrate, develop skills and get back into work.
This year, the Ben & Jerry’s Ice Academy helped refugees in the UK, the Netherland and Germany find their feet economically with entrepreneurship training, mentoring and part-time employment.
5. We got tasty with food and food waste
Just a few weeks ago, we threw open the doors to Hive, our new, state-of-the-art innovation hub in the Netherlands where we will collaborate and co-create to turn bright ideas into the healthy, sustainable foods of the future. We continued our work to develop more plant-based foods and even partnered with Burger King to launch the plant-based Rebel Whopper powered by The Vegetarian Butcher. And since a third of all food that’s produced globally gets wasted, we came up with some more ingenious ways of working with suppliers, restaurants and consumers to help reduce that unacceptable statistic.
6. We continued our push for global access to safe, clean sanitation
Celebrating sanitation may sound like a strange thing to do, but since two-thirds of people on the planet lack access to decent sanitation, we can’t underestimate its value. On World Toilet Day we told the stories of sanitation superheroes who are making clean toilets their mission. Our Domestos brand continues to spearhead Unilever’s hugely successful efforts, and in partnership with UNICEF, we have so far helped over 16 million people. And on a related note, Global Handwashing Day was even more special this year, as we shared the news that Lifebuoy has improved the handwashing behaviours of 1 billion people.
7. We smashed a few more stereotypes
It’s been three years since we announced our pledge to unstereotype our advertising. Since then we’ve been working on doing so across every brand and in every one of our markets. More of our campaigns this year sought to defy outdated and harmful cultural norms and instead were underpinned by inclusive, diverse and progressive portrayals of people. In May, Dove launched Project #ShowUs, a disruptive new partnership to shatter stereotypes. This is an image library created and curated exclusively by women, female-identifying and non-binary individuals. Also, Dove Men+Care tied up with Promundo to encourage and promote paternity leave.
8. We put our weight behind biodiversity and soil protection
This year, the business community increasingly got behind the global biodiversity agenda, fuelled in part by the Our Planet: Our Business documentary. But this is something we’ve been working on for some time. In fact, each year Knorr co-invests €1 million with our suppliers and farmers through the Knorr Partnership Fund. This money helps finance sustainable agriculture projects, many of which are focused on biodiversity.
On a smaller scale, there was a buzz around our office in southern Poland, where employee Agnieszka Przybyl is promoting urban beekeeping. And when it comes to protecting soil, we’re working with soy farmers and our soy oil suppliers to increase the use of cover crops. These help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and prevent erosion.
9. We focused our minds on mental health
Millennials have grown up on social media with its potential to connect. Yet they’ve been found to be the loneliest generation of all. And that’s not just a ‘soft’ health concern – it can be as bad for you as a packet of cigarettes a day. Lipton is helping to address the problem.
Tea’s ability to give people a reason to have a conversation lies at the heart of Lipton’s newly launched brand purpose to awaken the world to quality connections and fight against hidden loneliness. Alongside mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, loneliness can impact sleep quality, reasoning and productivity.
10. We got even more transparent with tea
In September, we published a full list of our global tea suppliers. This move is designed to further increase transparency in our supply chain and boost our ongoing efforts to transform the entire industry. As part of this, we created an interactive map that highlights some of the social programmes we are leading on the ground with NGOs and supplier partners. These programmes aim to enhance the livelihoods and wellbeing of local workers, farmers and their families. And it’s an area where we can have huge impact. As you’d expect from the world’s largest tea company.
text Starting in a few weeks, Unilever International, our global business unit specialising in white space channels, will be providing hygiene kits for Uber drivers and couriers in the UK.
Part of a new partnership with the ride-hailing and delivery platform, the project is set to expand to more countries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The kits are one of a number of safety measures being rolled out by Uber aimed at keeping both drivers and everyone who uses their app as safe and healthy as possible.
“As some countries around the world look to slowly ease out of lockdown, safe transportation will play a crucial role as we move into a new normal,” says Alan Jope, CEO, Unilever, emphasising the importance of maintaining the highest levels of hygiene in order to avoid a resurgence in cases.
“As people begin to venture out, we must collectively ensure that health and safety remains the absolute priority. We’re pleased that by partnering with Uber and providing our trusted hygiene products, Unilever is able to help keep drivers, couriers and riders as safe as possible,” he continues.
Kits will include a range of products such as Cif (Jif) Antibacterial Multi-Purpose Spray and Lifebuoy alcohol-based hand gel. The partnership will also provide education materials and training to drivers and couriers.
“After months of asking people to stay home for the safety of themselves and others, we are taking unprecedented measures to help our community get back to work and start moving again safely,” says Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO, Uber.
Concept to launch in just a few weeks
Set up in 2012 and headquartered in Singapore, Unilever International, the team that led this partnership, specialises in bringing Unilever brands into untapped countries, segments and channels – otherwise known as white spaces.
As some countries began to look at how to ease lockdown measures, the team quickly recognised that in order for people to begin to move around more in as safe a way as possible, they would need clean, hygienic public spaces and transportation.
Having identified this need, they moved fast, taking the idea from concept to a pilot in the UK at speed.
“We’re glad that Unilever International is able to provide Unilever’s world-class hygiene products to Uber’s drivers and couriers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as people start commuting and working again, and as we all start to transition into the new normal,” says Umesh Shah, CEO, Unilever International.
text Unilever has been identified as a global leader in corporate sustainability and awarded a place on this year’s Climate A List compiled by CDP, the non-profit environmental disclosure platform.
“We are delighted to be named by CDP as a leader in climate disclosure,” says Marc Engel, Unilever’s Chief Supply Chain Officer. “Every company should aspire to join the CDP A list, setting science-based targets for reducing emissions and disclosing their progress. Greater transparency is key to driving ambitious climate action and keeping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.”
CDP continues to be one of the most credible markers of sustainability leadership. Of the 8,000+ companies that reported to CDP on their climate impacts in 2019, only 179 – just 2% – earned a place on the A List. These also include Nestlé, L’Oréal, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart.
CDP scores companies in a range of areas such as disclosure of data, awareness of climate risks and demonstration of market-leading best practices.
Examples of best practice that CDP are looking for include setting science-based targets, using internal carbon pricing, shifting to renewable energy and carrying out climate scenario analysis in line with the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure framework.
Every company should aspire to join the CDP A list, setting science-based targets for reducing emissions and disclosing their progress. Marc Engel, Unilever’s Chief Supply Chain Officer 
Setting standards for others to follow
The A List was released on the eve of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this week. The focus of this year’s gathering of world leaders is how to mobilise business to respond to the risks of climate change. The CDP A List shows which companies are taking this global challenge seriously and working to address the risks.
Dexter Galvin, CDP’s Global Director of Corporations & Supply Chains, sees A Listers as blazing a trail and other companies should look to them for inspiration.
“The latest science says we need global emissions to urgently peak and start declining by 7.6% a year to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” says Dexter. “It’s clear that business has a critical role to play in this existential challenge.”
But this is far more than a ‘corporate responsibility’ exercise. Analysis shows that companies on the climate A List outperform their peers on the stock market. As Dexter points out: “Leading on climate action is good business in today’s economy – it will be essential business in tomorrow’s economy.”

text In September last year, we launched our €1 billion Clean Future innovation strategy to fundamentally change the way our cleaning and laundry products are created, manufactured and packaged. And at its heart is the ambition to replace ingredients derived from fossil fuels with alternatives from renewable or recycled sources by 2030.
As Peter ter Kulve, President of our Home Care division, said at the launch: “Clean Future is our vision to radically overhaul our business. As an industry, we must break our dependence on fossil fuels, including as a raw material for our products. We must stop pumping carbon from under the ground when there is ample carbon on and above the ground – if we can learn to utilise it at scale.”
Eliminating virgin fossil fuels from our formulations is better for the planet, better for consumers and better for our business. And we’re already seeing strong evidence of how this focus on sustainability is delivering in all three areas.
Our cleanest, greenest laundry products
To coincide with the Clean Future announcement, we relaunched our biggest laundry brand OMO – also known as Persil, Skip, Breeze, Ala, Surf Excel and Rinso, depending on where you live in the world – with its cleanest, greenest products yet. The formulation now contains plant-based stain removers, which we call ‘green carbon’. What’s more, the bottles are made with a minimum of 50% recycled plastic and are 100% recyclable. In some markets, we reduced our plastic by 75%. Furthermore, OMO is advocating to move the industry away from animal testing and has deployed digital programmes to power up youngsters to act for a better world.
The launch will be rolled out in all our Dirt Is Good brands – which are available in over 80 markets worldwide – and it’s already proving a popular choice for consumers, with record brand power scores. The initiative has also been recognised by WARC as the winner of the WARC Gold and Sustainability Awards for Most Effective Purposeful Campaign.
Dilutable detergent proving a hit in Latin America
OMO also launched our first dilute at home laundry detergent. Using the same concept as Cif ecorefill, the 6x concentrated formula is designed to be poured into a standard 3 litre bottle. The packaging uses 70% less plastic than a 3 litre bottle, is fully recyclable and contains 50% recycled plastic.
First launched in Brazil, the innovation proved an instant hit with consumers. So much so, we have now also rolled it out to other countries in Latin America, including Argentina and Chile. All while reducing plastic by 1,400 tons and transportation CO2 emissions by 83%.
OMO leads the capsules market in China
Consumers want products that are both more sustainable and more convenient and simpler to use, which is why our laundry capsules continue to increase in popularity. In 2018, we launched the format in China. The launch was a success and this year OMO capsules were ranked No.1 brand in retail and No.2 in e-commerce in China.
Earlier this year, we also launched the world’s first laundry capsule made using recycled carbon emissions. Through a pioneering new process, we’re capturing waste gases from a steel mill – before it reaches the atmosphere – and turning it into a cleaning ingredient.
The limited-edition capsules were first launched on JD and Tmall – which are China’s two leading e-commerce sites – followed by a Clean Future campaign, which resulted in over 300 million media impressions, with OMO capsules also having exceptional sales growth on both sites.
It’s brilliant to see all these innovations landing so positively with consumers around the world. Our Clean Future journey is well underway and, while there’s a lot still to do, the results so far show that demand is there.
Jon Hague, our VP for Science and Technology, who leads the Clean Future programme
The world’s first biosurfactant
When it comes to surfactants – a key cleaning ingredient that creates foam and allows products to work by breaking down oil, grease and soil – there are few sustainable alternatives out there. Working with a leading biotech firm, we created Rhamnolipids – a first-of-its kind for household cleaning products – made from naturally occurring fermentation and which is 100% biodegradable and renewable.
We’re pioneering large-scale production of this ingredient and, since the initial launch in Chile, we have also now rolled it out in our Sunlight brand in Vietnam.
Lifebuoy setting new standards with BotaniTech
In our new Covid reality, home hygiene has become a priority for us all and it’s a trend that seems to be here to stay. But not only are consumers in most markets cleaning more frequently than before, they are also becoming more discerning about what’s in the products they use and the effect they may have on the health of people and the planet.
To meet demand from consumers seeking disinfectants that will help keep them safe, while at the same time being kinder to them and the planet, Lifebuoy has developed Unilever’s first pH-neutral disinfectant. The BotaniTech range includes a multi-surface cleaner and eco-refill, a general cleaner, antibacterial wipes and an aerosol.
We have launched the range in the UK, Germany, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore and we’re currently rolling it out to more markets globally. With naturally derived cleaning ingredients, formulas that are 100% biodegradable and 100% recyclable packaging, the BotaniTech range aims to set a new standard in the aisles.
Creating a cleaner future… for all
Jon Hague, our VP for Science and Technology, who leads the Clean Future programme, says of the progress: “It’s brilliant to see all these innovations landing so positively with consumers around the world. Our Clean Future journey is well underway and, while there’s a lot still to do, the results so far show that demand is there – people are seeking out products that are better for them, their home and their families. And that’s what we’ve committed to deliver: for everyone, everywhere, within every budget.”

text Good news for new grads – that time you spent on Minecraft and World of Warcraft may have actually been time well spent.
Unilever has digitised its recruitment process and 20 minutes of gaming is now part of the mix.
The changes aim to keep pace with the expectations of potential millennial employees – 60% of whom, according to research by PwC, see an employer’s “provision of state of the art technology” as important when considering a job.
"From the CV, to the candidate search, to the interview, we're using technology to create a truly interactive experience allowing us to get a more meaningful connection with applicants,” explains Chief HR Officer Leena Nair.
“We know that people increasingly live their lives online and our recruitment process must reflect that. This new process will be faster, simpler and more flexible allowing graduates to fit applying around their lives,” she adds.
So how does it all work?
There are four steps to be completed to have the chance of being one of the 800 young leaders Unilever employs from the 250,000 people who apply each year.
Step 1
First off, the need to create a CV is no longer necessary. Instead, interest is registered using an online form where candidates can fill in details using their LinkedIn profile. Simple.
There’s no waiting around for a response either – an SMS or email acknowledging receipt of details will be pinged across asap.
Step 2
Now comes the fun bit – link to 12 games to play that will take 20 minutes max.
While those of us brought up on the pure entertainment of Mario and Donkey Kong may raise an eyebrow at online games being part of the recruitment process, take note: the games have been created not only to engage and entertain a digitally savvy audience but also to assess the skills required to become a young leader in various parts of the business.
The level playing field provided by anonymous game play also reduces the potential for unconscious bias among the recruiting team.
The fact that candidates can play in their own time, in their own space, and complete the entire process in 20 minutes cuts back on time and costs too.
In fact, the whole process is more agile. Candidates receive gameplay feedback within 48 hours. And the time from first application to offer has been reduced to less than two weeks for all applicants and could be as short as one to two days – a market-leading time between application and offer is circa 60 days.
Step 3
The next stage sees candidates recording a video interview on their tablet or smartphone at a time that suits them.
Step 4
The final step of the process sees candidates invited to a Discovery Centre to work through real-life business challenges and see for themselves what it’s like to work day to day at Unilever.
In a connected world, it’s key to attract tech savvy talent who can respond quickly to markets that are changing faster than ever before.
We know that 80% want to receive feedback in real time and have frequent check-ins on progress – as a company we want to ensure this is in place from recruitment forward.
“It is hoped that this innovative approach will provide an experience and help us attract the best young talent to the business, helping us in our vision to grow the business,” Leena concludes.
text About the author
CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of the Netherlands-based Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH).
IDH brings governments, companies and investors together in action-driven
coalitions to support the Sustainable Development Goals. Joost has been CEO
since the initiative’s foundation in 2008.
To celebrate our 90th birthday and help us look ahead to the next 90 years, we asked leading sustainability, purpose and business influencers to share their thoughts on how companies with purpose will be successful in the future.
At IDH, our job is to make sustainability mainstream in the international value chain. We’re driven by a public sector mandate from multiple European governments. But with the challenges the world faces today, there’s no way any government in the world could even come close to solving these issues without the reach and resources that the private sector can provide.
That’s why we work with a broad range of people in every part of the supply chain – from CEOs, governments and financiers to NGOs, smallholder farmers and aid agencies. The goal is to bring them together in partnerships that help to deliver on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
When I look back, initiatives like ours simply didn’t exist years ago. Issues such as climate change, deforestation and poverty were dealt with between governments. Corporate social responsibility, as it was then called, was on the margins for businesses, and the vast majority stayed well away from involvement in the development agenda.
That’s all changed. In the past decade, the power of collaboration is increasingly being put into practice and we’ve seen some encouraging results.
Partnerships between businesses, NGOs and governments to drive positive change are becoming the new normal. But when it comes to companies joining forces with other companies, we still have a long way to go.
Collaboration over competition
Businesses always find it particularly difficult to work with their competitors. It’s understandable. They’re vying with one another for the same consumers or customers, and there’s potential profit at stake. But I believe such partnerships can achieve incredible and long-lasting change when both parties are willing to make the leap.
One example that was a milestone for all of us at IDH was our work to bring together Hindustan Unilever (Unilever’s business in India) and Tata Global Beverages for a programme to drive large-scale change in India’s tea industry.
Unilever and Tata are the two biggest exporters of tea in the world and are, of course, major competitors. But they agreed that driving long-term, sustainable improvements to tea farming practices and securing the livelihoods of tens of thousands of smallholder farmers were causes worth backing together.
Having both of them at the table meant every value chain partner in the tea sector took notice. In fact, since Unilever and Tata lent their support to the programme in 2014, more than 55,000 tea growers have been awarded sustainable farming certification and we’ve been able to take sustainably sourced tea mainstream.
It took two years for Unilever and Tata to join forces. That might sound like a long wait, but many other businesses are far slower and more reluctant to put their short-term rivalry aside, despite the clear long-term impacts they could achieve.
Joost with James Mwangi, director of global change-makers organisation Dalberg 
Urgency is what we need. For companies with purpose to truly make the change we need to see, in the timescale in which we need to see it, businesses need to be far more radical.
Competitors must launch and deliver collaborations quickly and frequently. That will require courage on the part of leaders – to walk paths never before trodden and to take risks to innovate the way the world does business.
At 90 years of age, Unilever is getting there. I hope that’s something we see much more of in the decades to come.
text The USLP aimed to make us better.
Better socially.
Better environmentally.
And at the same time, better performing as a business.
A powerful impact – on those around us, and on ourselves
As we look back over our ten-year journey so far, we have much to be proud of. We’ve had a positive impact on the lives of millions of people, and on the planet.
But has it made us a better business?
We can see the evidence everywhere we look.
So as we celebrate the USLP and embark on the next chapter of our vision to be the leader in sustainable business globally, here are four ways that our USLP has made us stronger.
1. By growing our brands and driving innovation
Across the business, we’ve seen how our brands have become stronger with purpose and innovation – and how that has driven growth.
In 2014 we started to define and measure what we call our ‘sustainable living brands’.
These were not niche brands – they included household names like Dove, Lipton, Hellmann’s and Omo – as well as brands that are certified B-Corp, like Seventh Generation and Pukka tea. What they have in common is a powerful sense of purpose that aligns with consumers and the USLP.
And the fact that they have continuously and consistently outperformed the average growth rate of Unilever.
2. By reducing our risks and costs
Adopting sustainable business practices helps us secure supply and support growth.
We’re working with smallholder farmers, for example, on sustainable farming methods that increase their yields and mitigate the effects of climate change. Our Unilever Sustainable Living Report describes the progress we’ve made in Sustainable sourcing and Enhancing livelihoods.
The USLP has also helped us avoid costs. Through our eco-efficiency programme, for example, we have avoided over €1 billion in costs since 2008, by improving water and energy efficiency in our factories, and by using less material and producing less waste.

3. By attracting the best talent
People are undoubtedly our greatest asset. And the USLP has helped us attract, and retain, the best people, while contributing to greater trust in our business.
We are the No.1 consumer goods employer of choice for graduate students in over 50 countries. And when we ask our employees what they think, almost 90% say they feel proud to work for Unilever, while 79% feel their job contributes to the USLP.
4. By helping us cultivate partnerships and promote transformational change
We would never have been able to deliver the ambitious goals of the USLP alone. Working with others has hugely increased our reach – and our impact.
We’ve grown stronger through our work with suppliers, NGOs, social enterprises and government organisations. They’ve helped us enhance livelihoods, create opportunities for women and drive fairness. At the same time, they’ve helped us build trust in our business and our brands.

Sustainable success, and a foundation for the future
Our commitment to making sustainable living commonplace doesn’t end with the USLP.
Our long history of doing business with purpose and our ten-year USLP journey have shown us what a sustainable business can and should look like.
We’ve proved that brands with purpose grow. We’ve shown that companies with purpose last. And we’re convinced that people with purpose thrive.
With these three beliefs as our foundation, we’ll keep building a business that makes sustainable living commonplace for the 8 billion people that call this planet home.

text Unilever has been highlighted as a world leader in corporate sustainability by global environmental non-profit CDP, achieving a place on its ‘A List’ for climate change, protecting forests and water security.
Based on data submitted through CDP’s questionnaires, the list recognises those companies that are working to develop a sustainable economy through their actions to mitigate climate risk, protect forests and enhance water stewardship.
CDP’s annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely seen as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency.
“Unilever is committed to working with NGOs, governments and the wider industry to change the way the world does business,” says Unilever’s Chief Supply Chain Officer Marc Engel. “We’re delighted to have been recognised as a leader in water security, and the fight against deforestation and climate change.”
The A List companies are leading the market in corporate sustainability, tackling environmental risks and setting themselves up to thrive in tomorrow’s economy. Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP 
In 2019, over 525 investors with more than $96 trillion in assets and 125 major purchasers with $3.6 trillion in procurement spend requested companies to disclose data on environmental impacts, risks and opportunities through CDP’s platform.
CDP uses a detailed and independent methodology to assess the 8,400 respondents, allocating a score of A to D- based on the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets.
CDP’s scoring for forests is conducted through the lens of the four commodities that cause most deforestation: timber products, cattle products, soy and palm oil.
Paul Simpson, CEO of CDP, says: “The scale of the business risks from the climate emergency, deforestation and water insecurity are vast – as are the opportunities from addressing them – and it’s clear the private sector has a vital role to play at this critical time.
“The A List companies are leading the market in corporate sustainability, tackling environmental risks and setting themselves up to thrive in tomorrow’s economy.”

text Unilever celebrates its 90th anniversary this year. To mark the milestone, we asked business pioneers, thought-leaders and change-makers from across the globe to share their views on how companies with purpose can thrive into the future.
From established CEOs to emerging young entrepreneurs, here’s what they told us…
A commitment to community
Our desire to do good in the community never strayed from the front of my mind Tawee Rojanasinwilai, Founder of Taweekit 
Tawee Rojanasinwilai, owner of Thailand’s Taweekit retail chain, believes that doing the right thing by the communities you serve helps build a strong a strong foundation for any business.
In his article, he explained how, after building his company up from a single store to a nationwide network, he faced losing it all when the financial crisis of 1997 meant the firm’s financial assets were held in banks that had been forced to close.
Support and a stable supply chain from Unilever, plus a bold temporary move to sell from market stalls instead of stores, helped Tawee navigate his business back from the brink of collapse.
“Even at our lowest point, when the business was all but gone, this thinking – the principles of right and wrong, and our desire to do good in the community – never strayed from the front of my mind,” he said.
It’s a philosophy that served him well. Taweekit is set to open its 185th store this year.

Unleashing the potential of youth
Change is how we create things we haven’t seen before Draganah Omwange, Unilever Future Leader 
Kenya-based Draganah Omwange is on Unilever’s Future Leaders programme – an initiative to nurture talented young people across the company.
Draganah is the driving force behind a waste collection and recycling partnership which educates children about the value of discarded plastic. Since acting on her passion to rid Nairobi’s streets of litter, Draganah has led the U-Turn programme to reach 190 schools, inspiring thousands of pupils – and their families – to recycle their rubbish.
“Businesses need fresh ideas. They need people who see opportunity without seeing the barriers that sometimes come with experience,” she said.
“Change is how we create things we haven’t seen before – and that’s why young people must be brought into decision-making and their ideas given the space and opportunities to try things out. Especially when it comes to putting purpose at the centre of everything we do.”

From competitors to collaborators
Competitors must launch and deliver collaborations quickly and frequently Joost Oorthuizen, CEO of the IDH, the Sustainable Trade Initiative 
Joost Oorthuizen, CEO of the Netherlands-based Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), challenged companies to see their competitors not just as rivals, but as invaluable collaborators towards a greater purpose.
“Competitors must launch and deliver collaborations quickly and frequently. That will require courage on the part of leaders – to walk paths never before trodden and to take risks to innovate the way the world does business,” he said.

The responsibility of being a beloved brand
When you’re in the hearts of people, you have a responsibility Piyush Pandey, Ogilvy’s Global Chief Creative Director and Executive Chairman, India 
Piyush Pandey, Global Chief Creative Officer at Ogilvy, shared his thoughts on how products are made in factories, but brands that last are those forged in people’s hearts.
“When you’re in the hearts of the people you have a responsibility to delight them, and to be part of their lives when they are in pain. When there are concerns. When there are things like physical, emotional or environmental pressure.
“The brands that can do this job, are the brands that become a brand like Unilever,” he said.

Time to change the rules of the game
If Earth-trashing economic growth and ruthlessly promoted consumerism, where everything has to be as cheap as possible for Western consumers, remain the drivers of what we think of as ‘progress’ today… how can any company, even one as committed as Unilever, genuinely aspire to make a real difference? Jonathon Porritt, Founding Director of Forum for the Future 
Founding Director of Forum for the Future, environmentalist and broadcaster Jonathon Porritt reflected on his personal experience of acting as an adviser to Unilever for more than 20 years.
During that time he saw the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan take shape, outlining our commitment to reducing our impact on the planet while pursuing ambitious growth. Looking ahead, he challenged businesses with purpose to radically change the system.
“If Earth-trashing economic growth and ruthlessly promoted consumerism, where everything has to be as cheap as possible for Western consumers, remain the drivers of what we think of as ‘progress’ today, compounded by continuing population growth, how can any company, even one as committed as Unilever, genuinely aspire to make a real difference?” he said.

text Every year, we recognise pioneering individuals within the company who have brought our values to life and truly embody what it means to be part of Unilever. Our 2019 Heroes with Impact have gone above and beyond their day-to-day jobs. Their stories paint a picture of passion, purpose and drive.
Childcare for working parents is not easy to access in China, even in a big city like Shanghai. There is a shortage of pre-school facilities, few are properly authorised and where they exist, they are expensive. This shortage was having a direct impact on Unilever employees.
Likewise, medical resources are limited in China, and any hospital appointments entail long waiting times.
In both these areas, Jessica Yao, Senior Tax Manager in our Shanghai office, identified practical paths to help counter the shortages in provision. Impelled by a wish and a sense of purpose to help others live healthy and happy lives, she set about realising change.
Childcare and healthcare
As a Unilever manager, trade union representative and the deputy of Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress, Jessica was able to tap into her contacts and find an effective way forward. She helped set up a childcare centre project, with a pilot in Unilever Shanghai. This involved securing a licence for the centre and finding a qualified third party to manage it. Now it is up and running, and bringing direct benefits to working parents.
“Here at Unilever, parents and children are taken care of, and the trade union is like a mother to us,” says one employee who uses the childcare centre.
In the belief that prevention is better than cure, Jessica is bringing health advice into the company. She is the driving force behind health talks that are delivered on-site to Unilever employees on topics such as musculo-skeletal disorders and back pain, sight problems and parenting issues. To promote health and wellbeing, she has helped ensure that sports facilities for basketball, badminton and more are made available to employees.
Tackling commuting issues
And Jessica’s contributions to making working life easier go beyond the company. For Shanghai commuters working in the Hongqiao business district – a development zone near one of the city’s airports – the journey to work means traffic congestion and delay. In her role as deputy of the Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress, Jessica proposed a new overpass to alleviate congestion – an idea that is now included in the government construction plan. She is also working with city authorities to progress the idea of integrating the railway and metro bus systems. An easier commute lies ahead!
The improvements that Jessica brought about are having a tangible impact on the lives of Unilever employees. “This is very much in line with Unilever’s strategic purpose,” she says. It is also in line with her own aspirations. “Small actions can have a big impact. If others can get my help to solve their problems, I will be very happy,” she adds.

Around 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Take a walk on any beach and you will see the spectacle of plastic waste. Silent, omnipresent and a threat to wildlife, plastic debris is a universal problem – and it has risen swiftly up the global agenda. Unilever has stepped up its ambitious targets on plastics.
While companies like Unilever are recognising their responsibilities, individuals are also eager to play their part. Atahan Ozgunay, R&D Packaging Manager for Foods & Tea in Turkey, is among them. One of the brands he works with is Knorr. Its dry soups, in particular, are widely enjoyed in Turkey. However, the flexible packaging could not be recycled.
“We need to design our packaging in a way that it can be reused, recycled or get composted,” he says. But developing a recyclable version was technically challenging.
Solving a complex problem
Dry soups have a long shelf life of 18–24 months, so the pack had to be highly protective. And the production processes for making the recyclable packs also had to be within the capabilities of the factory.
To develop a solution, Atahan set up a network of stakeholders including sustainability NGO ÇEVKO, suppliers Jindal and Polinas, local converter Mondi Kalenobel (which manufactures the packaging for us), recycling companies and consumers. By bringing all the parties together, it was possible to understand the wider interests and see the bigger picture.
Atahan also devoted much of his free time to the project. “I really worked with passion,” he says. “And at the end, a light came on and I found something. I immediately shared it with my team.” The solution he identified covered all the bases: a long shelf life, the opportunity for recycling, ease of manufacture and consumer buy-in.
The result was flexible and eco-friendly packs for Knorr soups. Unilever provided the specification to Mondi Kalenobel which produces the new soup packs and the packs are then filled at Unilever’s Besan factory in Istanbul.
The packaging has been formally certified as recyclable. In terms of production, no modification to existing factory lines was required to manufacture the soup packs.
Changing attitudes
But recycling solutions are only as good as the trust they inspire. Atahan didn’t just see the project as a technical packaging innovation. For him, it was also an opportunity to change consumer attitudes.
This saw him holding a workshop on sustainable packaging claims, working with consumers, marketing teams and agencies to identify the best way to communicate the recyclability message on-pack. And despite the project’s overall complexity, Atahan’s commitment ensured that it was fast-tracked and completed within a year. This meant that in May 2019, the first recyclable Knorr soup packs were launched in Turkey.
Atahan believes that the recyclable flexible pack will make a serious contribution to the circular economy and hopes that the success of the project will inspire other FMCG companies to do the same.

text Vasiliki Petrou, Executive Vice President and Group CEO, Unilever Prestige 
Think of Unilever’s beauty brands and perhaps the first that spring to mind are household names like Dove, Vaseline, Pond’s, Lux and Sunsilk. But in the past few years our beauty business has evolved – and a new stable of luxury brands is driving rapid growth.
Unilever Prestige was launched in 2014, when its Executive Vice President and Group CEO Vasiliki Petrou was tasked with bringing a world-class portfolio of premium beauty brands into the company.
Seven years and nine brands later, Unilever Prestige reported €700 million in turnover in 2020 and strong double-digit growth in our most recent results for 2021. Our ambition now is to build a business worth at least €3 billion in the next few years through digital commerce, innovation, acquisitions and expansion.
While every Prestige brand has a distinct identity, one thing they all have in common is a clear, meaningful purpose. From REN’s zero-waste packaging to Hourglass’s commitment to cruelty-free, every brand is taking a stand on a relevant, authentic issue – and making a difference.
We caught up with Vasiliki to find out more about Unilever Prestige’s story so far…
Vasiliki, which brands comprise Unilever Prestige?
Since our launch in 2014, we have acquired nine carefully chosen brands. Within our first year we acquired REN, Dermalogica, Kate Somerville and Murad. In 2017, Living Proof and Hourglass joined the business. Two years later we added Garancia and Tatcha, and in 2021 we were delighted to bring Paula’s Choice on board.
How would you categorise these brands?
Our brands fit into three key areas. In Clinical Derma Cosmetics we have Dermalogica, the world’s No.1 professional skincare brand, available in more than 20,000 salons worldwide. Murad is a doctor-led clinical and wellness brand, with the No.1 brightening and retinol products in the US. And Kate Somerville is loved by A-listers and beauty gurus, with a must-visit clinic in Los Angeles.
Our Clean and Clinical segment includes Garancia, the fastest-growing pharmacy brand in France. We also have REN, which is clean to skin and clean to the planet. It recently launched the world’s first infinitely recyclable aluminium sachet. And our most recent acquisition, Paula’s Choice, is a direct-to-consumer powerhouse and one of the most successful brands in US beauty retailer Sephora.
Our third category is called High Performance. This includes premium, cruelty-free beauty brand Hourglass, which has the fastest-selling mascara in British beauty retailer Space NK. We have Living Proof premium haircare, which was created in partnership with scientists at MIT and is the No.2 prestige haircare brand in the US. Then we also have Tatcha, a luxury skincare brand rooted in Japanese rituals. It’s a digital and social commerce pioneer and Sephora’s second bestselling line.
What makes these brands different from others in Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care business?
I refer to our Prestige brands as a string of pearls. A beautiful set of sophisticated businesses, threaded together yet shining independently. Many of the founders who created them remain very involved in how the brands are run.
Just ten markets around the world make up 70% of our sales in Prestige. So with them our priority isn’t to reach the greatest number of consumers. Instead, it’s vital to reach the right markets in the right way. While our mass-market brands benefit from being widely available, in Prestige a certain level of scarcity drives desirability.
Social media and e-commerce are also huge drivers for our Prestige brands, and they’re outpacing the market with more than 50% of our turnover coming from online sales. Of course, online sales are accelerating for all types of products – but with premium beauty brands, direct-to-consumer sales have been a priority for quite some time.
So how do Prestige brands fit in to Unilever’s wider business?
Every brand at Unilever has to have purpose. It’s our overarching aim to make sustainable living commonplace. That’s the anchor between our Prestige brands and Unilever’s wider portfolio.
Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care division introduced the Positive Beauty vision and strategy earlier this year, committing to embrace a new era of beauty that’s inclusive, equitable and regenerative. One that’s better for people and for the planet.
In Unilever Prestige we believe in the same principles. If a brand doesn’t have purpose, then it doesn’t belong here. We are building a business of principled and authentic brands which consumers trust and believe in. Consumers want to see the brands they love standing up for something bigger than beauty. Every single one of our brands does just that.
Unilever Prestige has seen incredible growth since its launch. What are your big bets for the future?
Digitisation is one. We know around 70% of consumers worldwide use social platforms to search and shop for products and the global social commerce market is expected to reach more than $3 billion by 2028. Our brands have been quick to move into this area. Dermalogica is enjoying success on TikTok and has introduced a virtual reality store. Living Proof has a number of long-term influencer partnerships. And we’ve stepped into gaming too, with Tatcha introducing its own island on Animal Crossing to mark the launch of a new cleanser.
Innovation is another growth driver for us, and here we benefit enormously from leveraging the best of Unilever’s R&D capabilities. One of my favourite launches from the past year is Hourglass Red 0. It’s a true red lipstick made with a new patent-pending vegan alternative to carmine, the industry’s standard red pigmentation which is sourced from crushed insects. It took our scientists three years to develop but we’re planning to make the process open-source so others can apply the same technology. It’s a perfect fit with Hourglass’s ongoing commitment to animal welfare.
Our third big bet comes back to purpose. We know consumers expect more from brands than ever before and that consumer trust builds brand growth. So as our brands grow, we’re committed to growing their positive impact too.
Dermalogica, for example, is enabling women to achieve financial independence through training and empowering them with new professional skills. REN is continuing its zero-waste mission and this year launched the We Are Allies campaign, joining with competitor brands to pledge to reduce packaging waste. Kate Somerville’s mission is inspired by Kate’s own experiences and a desire to create positive change for generations to come. The brand is supporting young people who are ageing out of the foster care system, providing them with mentorship and training.
So what’s your big ambition for Unilever Prestige?
This year we have an annualised turnover of around €1 billion, so we’re close to a significant milestone. And we have big plans. My goal is to grow our Prestige business to at least €3 billion in the years ahead and our big bets – digitisation, innovation and purpose – will be crucial to achieving this.
Unilever Prestige is full of passionate, talented people and I’m honoured to be working alongside many of the founders who created our incredible brands. Together we can continue proving that purpose really is good for business.

text We’re supporting calls for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics. And we hope that through collaboration between companies, NGOs and governments – and the dedication of scientists passionate about the cause – it will soon be possible for all cosmetic products to be sold without the need for animal testing anywhere in the world.
Unilever is one of just five companies listed by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) as a company ‘working for regulatory change’. In fact, R&D experts at our Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre (SEAC) in Colworth, UK have been working on developing and using alternatives to animal testing to assure product safety for more than 30 years.
We caught up with five scientists who are part of the SEAC team and some of its rising stars. All five are women. They’re all under the age of 30. And they’re all passionate about the role science and technology can play in ending animal testing.
Today, on the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, they share a little about their work, their motivations and their advice for young women hoping to carve their own career in scientific research. Scroll through the carousel below to read their stories, in their own words.
Our scientists’ stories
Sophie Cable, Product Safety Scientist
For as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to be a scientist. So working in human safety is pretty much a dream come true for me. I joined Unilever two years ago and, as a safety scientist, it’s my job to ensure that any new ingredient or product that Unilever makes will be safe for anyone who uses it. As part of this, I’m working on ‘next-generation risk assessments’ which use the newest techniques to assess that the ingredients we use in our products are safe without testing them on animals.
We’re sharing our approach to safety assessment using non-animal methods with other academics, industries and regulators and I’m hopeful that this could be the start of a journey that one day sees a global ban on animal testing.
To any girls seeking a career in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects, I’d say you should never stop pursuing something you’re passionate about. Many of the people who inspired me are women, and we need the next generation of role models.
Elin Barrett, Computational Chemist
Making cosmetics cruelty-free has been something I've cared about for a long time, so when I realised there was a way to apply my chemistry degree in order to hopefully advance that cause, it felt like the perfect fit.
I develop and apply computational methods which can be used to determine potential hazards for molecules, as a replacement for animal testing. It means we’re using technology to assess that the shampoo you wash your hair with, or the cream that you use to moisturise your face, are safe to use. No animals are involved in the process at all.
The work of scientists and communicators in this area was the reason Dove, one of our biggest brands, was able to be accredited as cruelty-free by PETA in 2018 – a very exciting step in the right direction.
I think it’s vital that more girls pursue roles in science. Many of the challenges the world is facing will need scientists to solve them. A career in science can empower you to make a difference in a cause you care about.
Georgia Reynolds, Product Safety Scientist
During my studies I learnt about traditional methods to safety testing, and it made me redirect my planned career path into finding alternative methods. My work at Unilever involves leading projects in skin allergy and immunology to investigate and develop non-animal methods that ensure the safety of our beauty and personal care products, without testing on animals.
I always thought pursuing science meant I would become a doctor or work in the pharmaceutical industry, but I’ve learnt that if you can find something you’re interested in and explore it enough, there will be science behind it. If you have a passion, then you can always apply science to make a difference.
Part of the reason I wanted to work for Unilever was because it is at the forefront of developing non-animal methods. I now feel privileged to be a part of that. I get to work with some of the world’s leading scientists in this area and apply these strategies to ensure consumers have safe products to use on a daily basis. Not only this, but I also get to travel and present to other scientists around the world to inform and educate them on these methods.
Mabel Cotter, Product Safety Scientist
If one of Unilever’s brands want to include a new ingredient in a product, try to use an ingredient in a new way, such as a shower foam instead of a shower gel, or use more ingredient in a product than they currently do – that’s where I come in. My job is to risk-assess the ingredient and conclude whether the proposed use is safe or not.
I’m passionate about it because I’m a consumer too. And as a consumer, I want and expect the products I use to be safe.
Remember that time you washed your hair and didn’t get ill afterwards? That was me! Or that time you used a moisturiser and didn’t develop an allergic reaction? You’re welcome. Although a lot of the work we do is behind the scenes, ultimately the decisions we make can impact the 2.5 billion people that use Unilever products every day.
It’s varied, interesting and challenging work and science can take you places. In the two years since I joined Unilever’s R&D team, I’ve had the opportunity to present my work in Belgium, Austria and the US, as we share our discoveries with a wider community.
Mona Delagrange, Product Safety Scientist
At Unilever we invest a lot of time and resource to improve the ways in which we study risks that some chemicals might pose to consumers. We do so not by using animals, but instead by designing computer models or cell-based tests, that are much more relevant to human biology than using animals. I care deeply about animal welfare and so designing alternatives to animal testing feels extremely empowering to me.
I feel like my work makes an impact because my advice can determine whether a new product or ingredient will be placed on the market. That’s also why we need to make sure that our methods of assessing the safety of an ingredient are based on robust scientific methods. The fact we can do this without using animals in the process is something I’m very proud about.
If you want to understand human biology, are curious about chemical activity and care about animal welfare, safety science (toxicology) is the field where you can combine all of these. Whatever small contribution you can make is very rewarding because you’re not only keeping consumers safe and happy, but also helping to improve the process for future generations.

text Belgium is the second-largest producer of food waste in the European Union. It wastes 10,400 tons every day. And that doesn’t just have an economic impact, it has an environmental one.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, food waste is responsible for 8% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the US and China in terms of impact on global warming.
Zero waste is a target for the Benelux region, so finding solutions for food waste was front of mind for Unilever’s Manager for Knorr Soups and Snacking, Axel Driegelinck, when he attended Belgium’s largest food and catering conference Horeca Expo, late last year. At the event he met Katelijne Berx, Key Account Manager of the increasingly popular food app, Too Good To Go.
“The app’s concept is simple,” explains Axel. “If a restaurant or retailer knows they aren’t going to sell all of their stock they log their surplus on the app. This stock then appears on a map. Consumers can see what is available near them and buy it at a discount. After they’ve made a purchase, they have a few hours to collect.”
Axel and Katelijne wanted to see what opportunities use of the app could offer to Unilever and waste-conscious Belgian customers.
They decided to run a pilot, offering consumers the chance to buy Knorr soups, Lipton’s ice tea lychee bottles and Ben & Jerry’s products which could no longer be sold to retailers because they were nearing their sell-by date.
Running close to the sell-by date did not pose any health and safety issues for our brands or the consumers who bought them. “Goods were all still at least a day in date and Too Good To Go’s concept is very clear,” Axel explains.
A trial that left consumers asking for more
“We offered trays of products on the app for a limited window of time,” says Axel. “Buyers could purchase them and pick up the goods from Unilever’s office, using their own bags and boxes.”
The products were sold at a considerable discount so revenue from the trial was small. But that’s just one part of the story. “This pilot was run to scope the business potential and see if there was a consumer need,” Axel explains.
“Consumers know that the products will go over date soon so there were no complaints. In fact, we got amazing ratings. Everyone who picked up their orders asked us if we would be doing this again.”
“What we saw was that there is a community of users that communicate about offers going on,” says Axel. “A lot of Unilever colleagues also asked about the app and downloaded it to have a look.”
Enjoying food that would otherwise be wasted
“During the pilot we sold two pallets, each containing 1,000 products, in one day, in one city,” says Axel. “Potentially, we could do this all year in all Belgian cities. If we sold one pallet per day (for 200 days) in each of the country’s five big cities we’d sell around 1,000 pallets per year. There are 1,000 products per pallet so that means 1 million products/year,” Axel says.
The team are now looking to roll out the concept beyond Brussels. “Too Good To Go exists in most of Europe’s big cities,” says Axel, and people are beginning to take notice. “The app recently reached a milestone of 1 million orders delivered – that’s consumers buying goods that would have otherwise been wasted,” he says.
The pilot had other wins besides potential revenue. “It means we can offset the cost of obsolete stock,” explains Axel. “And it fits in with our mission to reduce food waste.
“At Unilever we aim to produce the best products in the best possible way. But waste is unavoidable and if we are transparent about it and search for solutions, we obviously are one step ahead – always.”
text Unilever’s first toothbrush made from 100% recycled plastic has just launched in France, and it’ll be reaching further countries soon.
The new Signal Ecolo Clean toothbrush is made from 100% food-grade post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, while its smart design features a comfortable, ergonomic hollow handle with 40% less plastic than an ordinary toothbrush – saving 10 tonnes of plastic in its first year.
And at the end of its life, the toothbrush needn’t contribute to landfill or disturb fragile ocean ecosystems. It’s 100% recyclable, thanks to a consumer-return partnership with global recycling company TerraCycle®. TerraCycle collection points. This launch builds on the partnership Unilever has with TerraCycle in many countries.
Ecolo Clean also comes in a paper pack, which is fully recyclable.
Zero plastic, less plastic, better plastic
With this launch, Signal has produced the first toothbrush to tick all the boxes on Unilever’s new commitment to creating a circular economy for plastic – cutting virgin plastic out of the process. And it’s a perfect fit with our agenda on plastics which has three strong pillars: no plastic (the box), less plastic (the light, smart design), and better plastic (the fully recycled plastic handle).
“At the start of 2019 we launched Signal’s first bamboo toothbrush to reduce the brand’s impact on the environment. Now, with Ecolo Clean, we’ve seized this opportunity to lead a massive sustainable change in the toothbrush category,” says Project Leader Leila Esmaeili.
“And this is just the beginning,” she adds. “Across every part of Unilever we have the objective to cut our use of virgin plastic by half and use 100% reusable, recyclable plastic by 2025. We’re working on it now.”
We are committing to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging, and to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.
text I wanted to update you on a new set of actions we will be taking to protect ourselves against coronavirus (Covid-19).
The situation has now been confirmed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. It is clear that the global threat from coronavirus is continuing to grow, and at a rapidly accelerating rate. There are now more than 120,000 recorded cases in over 100 countries, and sadly more than 4,700 people have died as a result. This week's message from the World Health Organization was unequivocal – that humanity's success in tackling coronavirus effectively is heavily dependent on the actions that organisations take over the next few days to help slow down its spread and avoid overloading health care systems.
As you know, since the initial outbreak in China, we have put in place measures to help minimise the risk from coronavirus to our employees and their families. Our approach has been one of abundant caution, and the speed of response and collective responsibility I have seen across Unilever has been truly heroic. Not only in China and Italy, where we have been most impacted, but in many other parts of the company too. Thank you for your professionalism and commitment.
However, it is very clear that we now need to go to the next level.
As a result, today I am announcing the following measures for all our people, including contractors, globally. They are most simply broken down into 'musts' and 'must nots':
THE MUST NOTS:
You must not …
Travel by air either internationally or domestically. Any air travel which is currently booked, apart from return-bound flights, will be cancelled centrally by our travel booking partners.
Work from any Unilever site other than your principal location.
Enter a Unilever site if you are suffering from cold or flu-like symptoms.
Invite any visitors onto a Unilever site without the prior approval of the site leader.
Attend meetings, conferences or events of more than 20 people.
THE MUSTS:
You must …
Self-isolate for 14 days if you are experiencing any cold or flu-like symptoms or have returned to your country from another location for either business or personal reasons.
Apply hand sanitiser when you enter a Unilever site.
Undergo thermal testing upon arrival at any Unilever site as legislation and equipment allows.
Use non-physical greetings (ie avoid shaking hands) and maintain appropriate "social distance".
For the avoidance of doubt, all these measures are applicable to all employees, irrespective of role or geography.
We are also applying additional measures which vary based on whether you have an office-based role, work in a sourcing unit, or are one of our field sales or retail staff:
Sourcing Units And Distribution Centres
All of our sourcing units and distribution centres will apply specialist tiered protocols to protect our workers while supporting business continuity. Country leadership teams will continue to monitor carefully and engage with site leads as appropriate.
Strict site protocols for hygiene and social distancing are also being put in place.
Field Sales And Retail Staff (Including 3P Field Sales and Merchandisers)
All field sales employees should connect with customers virtually wherever possible and minimise the use of public transport if a customer visit is necessary.
Strict protocols on social distancing (including non-physical greetings), and hand hygiene (especially after handling cash) will also be put in place and will be communicated shortly.
Office-Based Roles
All office-based employees globally should work from home. Any exceptions (which we expect to be few and far between, and most probably due to the need to access data-intensive systems) must be approved by the country General Manager.
The only country where this does not apply is in China, where people are beginning to return to work per national controls.
R&D
For R&D colleagues who work in laboratories or pilot plants on essential activities, protocols are now in development and will be shared by R&D site leads.
It is likely that some R&D roles will follow the office-based protocols and some will follow the Sourcing Unit rules.
More details about these changes, which will be effective from Tuesday 17 March, will be shared by your country General Manager early next week.
I hope you agree that these measures are the right thing to do. They have been developed based on the latest scientific and medical advice and are designed to protect our safety, our families' safety, and the safety of the communities in which we operate and live. They also demonstrate Unilever's leadership as a responsible, purpose-led business.
We are continuing to support global and local authorities by donating hygiene products to support the fight against coronavirus and we will be further stepping-up these efforts in the days ahead.
I am acutely aware that these changes to our working arrangements will have a big impact on our lives. None of the measures have been taken without careful thought and consideration about what this will mean for all of us, and I want to reassure you that we will support you through this change.
Further information – and regular updates – will follow. This will include more details on the protocols being put in place to help protect Sourcing Unit and Distribution colleagues, as well as Field Sales and Retail Staff. Also, for those of you who are about to embark on what we expect to be an extended period of working from home, we will shortly be sharing more guidance to help you during this period.
These are unprecedented times. Now, more than ever we need to stay calm, be resourceful, and do what we do best: focus on supporting each other, meeting the changing needs of our consumers, and on serving our customers.
Thank you again for your commitment.
Stay safe, stay well, and take care.

text At the end of last year, we launched a plastic waste reduction trial for our Sedal brand that’s proved so successful, we’re planning to roll it out across the country.
We set up refill stations in ten Walmart stores allowing consumers to fill up reusable aluminium bottles with Sedal shampoo rather than buying the product in the usual plastic bottles.
This is the first time one of our Beauty & Personal Care brands has conducted a reuse-refill trial in Mexico, and the reaction from consumers so far has been extremely positive.
In the first ten days, we sold two tonnes of Sedal shampoo in the new aluminium bottles, and that level of demand has remained pretty much constant ever since.
While consumers pay for the reusable bottle in the first instance, every time they refill it, the product is cheaper than if the equivalent amount was purchased in a plastic bottle.
Expanding the initiative
We chose aluminium bottles as they are highly durable and infinitely recyclable.
To get the trial up and running as quickly as possible – so we could gauge if there was a demand for this kind of self-service solution – we used a simple, mechanical pump for the prototype system which dispenses one litre of product per use.
Now that we know the interest is there, we plan to expand the project.
The success of the Sedal Refilleries led to Walmart naming Unilever Mexico its Supplier of the Year for sustainability.
As Rodrigo Reynoso, VP Beauty & Personal Care Marketing at Unilever Mexico, says: “I’m extremely happy to see the impact of something that started out as a dream due to all the hurdles and uncertainties that lay ahead of us. But through agile working and our passion behind something that Unilever truly stands for, we accomplished what many saw as impossible.”

Our wider efforts on plastic packaging
Mexico is the second-largest producer of plastic waste in Latin America, so we’re committed to finding solutions to the problem.
As part of our ongoing efforts to help create a ‘Mexico free of waste’, we are continually developing new packaging for our products. This includes the use of recycled PET and HDPE.
Through local environmental NGO ECOCE, we have recovered more than 6,000 tonnes of equivalent volume of post-consumer PET since 2017. We are now working with ECOCE and other industry players to help develop the recycling ecosystem for HDPE in Mexico, in order to recover more than 11,000 tonnes of post-consumer plastics per year.
text You may already know that Unilever makes many much-loved, household-name brands like Lipton, Knorr, Dove, Rexona, Hellmann’s and Omo.
You may also know that our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace because we believe we have the opportunity – and the responsibility – to be a force for good in the world.
But Unilever is a hugely diverse business with a rich heritage.
So to mark our 90th birthday this week, we thought we’d lift the lid on a few aspects of our company that you may not be familiar with.
We built a village… and an internationally renowned art gallery
In 1886, with 450 tons of Sunlight soap being made every week, the scale of the business encouraged William Lever to buy a large factory in Liverpool and build a village for its workers. This was all part of a business model he termed ‘prosperity-sharing’ – providing employees with decent and affordable houses, amenities and welfare provisions that made their lives secure and comfortable and enabled them to flourish as people.
Port Sunlight is still a fully functioning village as well as a major tourist attraction, not least because it’s home to the Lady Lever Art Gallery (pictured above) which is regarded as one of the finest art galleries in Europe.
We diversified into ice cream… from sausages
In 1922, Lever Brothers bought Wall’s, a popular sausage company. However, at the time, perishable products couldn’t be properly distributed and sales dropped dramatically during warmer weather. So Richard Wall had the idea to diversify into ice cream to keep business up in the summer months. Initial sales were disappointing, as retailers were reluctant to buy in quantity. The solution was to sell directly to the consumer with salesmen sent out on tricycles.
This was the first time in Britain that ice cream had been factory-made, pre-hardened and wrapped for mass distribution, branded and retailed in this way. Today Wall’s helps thousands of long-term unemployed individuals and young people earn a living by becoming ice-cream vendors.
450t In 1886, Lever & Co were making 450 tons of Sunlight soap every week
We empowered women, right from the start
We believe that women’s empowerment is the single greatest enabler of human development and economic growth. When women are guaranteed equal rights, skills and access to opportunities – and when the norms and stereotypes that hold women back are challenged – the effect is transformational. This thinking was around from the very start.
William Lever was promoting equal rights for women as early as 1916. In 1939, Marjorie Plear became the first of many women to receive the Leverhulme Pharmaceutical scholarship, an initiative he founded to support women in further education. And in 1953, Doreen Wedderburn became Unilever’s first female manager and went on to become the first woman divisional manager in our research organisation.
We invented fish fingers
In 1955, we introduced UK consumers to fish fingers. They proved an instant hit and, within a decade, accounted for 10% of British fish consumption. These were developed by Frosted Foods, owner of Birds Eye. This long history of innovation in foods is very much alive today. In fact, we recently opened a state-of-the-art innovation hub in the Netherlands where we will collaborate and co-create to turn bright ideas into the healthy, sustainable foods of the future. And we’re working with leading scientists, nutritionists and agricultural experts to develop more plant-based foods that are better for people and the planet.
We aired the first-ever TV ad in the UK
Also in 1955 (clearly a busy year for us), we aired the very first ad on UK commercial TV, for Gibbs SR toothpaste. Later, in 1969, we aired the UK’s first colour TV ad, this time for Birds Eye peas. But being innovative with advertising was nothing new. In fact, it was key to the early success of William Lever’s Sunlight soap, with its brand message focused on alleviating drudgery in the lives of working-class housewives.
Our audience may be much broader these days and the output more sophisticated, but the aim is the same – to drive business growth through brands that provide a positive change to people and society.
We took a stand on environmental protection in the 1970s
Our efforts to safeguard the environment began in earnest decades ago. In 1972, our Packaging Services division published ‘Environmental Issues and Packaging Policies in Unilever companies’, which highlighted how to avoid over-packaging across our suite of brands. And in 1982, we made a public pledge to take a stand against the hazardous effects of pollution on the atmosphere. Today, reducing our environmental impact sits at the heart of our strategy. Our most recent commitment is to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging, and to collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.
We once owned the Calvin Klein brand
In 1989, Unilever acquired the Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company, and with it the Calvin Klein brand. It offered a complete range of beauty products in addition to its core fragrance business. We sold the brand to Coty Inc NY in 2005. Also in 1989, we acquired Elizabeth Arden/Fabergé. We sold that in 2001.
Beauty and Personal Care is big business for us today, and the ‘care’ in the name is part of our DNA. Since our founder, William Lever, developed Sunlight Soap to improve the health and hygiene of all members of society in 1885, we have been creating products that help make sustainable living commonplace.
See how our business has changed and grown on our Unilever timeline.
text Urgent action is needed to tackle the plastic pollution crisis. That’s why on 6 March Unilever signed the European Plastics Pact – an initiative that brings together governments, NGOs and business to accelerate progress towards a circular economy where plastic is repurposed and reused rather than simply discarded.
The public–private coalition sees 15 governments and over 70 companies and organisations join forces in pledging to avoid plastic waste across their value chains.
All participants have committed to hit four bold targets by 2025, and progress will be monitored and reported upon annually.
Here’s a little more about those goals, and how they compare to the ambitions we already have in place across Unilever:
1. Participants will design all plastic packaging and single-use plastic products placed on the market to be reusable where possible, and in any case recyclable.
Back in 2017, we made a commitment to ensure that 100% of our plastic packaging will be designed to be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and we’re making steady progress.
2. Participants will move towards a more responsible use of plastic packaging and single-use plastic products, aiming to reduce virgin plastic products and packaging by at least 20% by weight, with half of this reduction coming from an absolute reduction in plastics.
At Unilever we have already pledged to halve the amount of virgin plastic in our packaging by the same deadline. We are doing so by reducing our absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating the use of recycled plastic.
3. Increase the collection, sorting and recycling capacity by at least 25 percentage points, and reach a level that corresponds to market demand for recycled plastics.
In 2019, we pledged to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.
4. Increase the use of recycled plastics in new products and packaging, achieving an average of at least 30% recycled plastics (by weight) in product and packaging ranges.
In 2017, we pledged to increase the amount of recycled plastic in our packaging to at least 25% by 2025. We want to use far more PCR plastic in the future and recapture our own packaging, and we’re working with partners across our supply chain to explore this.
“The launch of the European Plastics Pact is a clear signal from Unilever and other signatories that we are ready to move faster towards a circular economy for plastics,” says Hanneke Faber, President, Global Foods & Refreshment, Unilever.
“We are confident this initiative will help us to find new ways to reduce, reuse and recycle plastic packaging to meet our ambitious Unilever commitments. Now let’s go and deliver.”

text T2, Unilever’s premium tea brand, has achieved B Corp accreditation, recognising its commitment to sustainability and its progressive approach towards creating an inclusive culture.
Short for Benefit Corporation, B Corp certification is awarded only to businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.
T2 now joins a worldwide B Corp community and becomes the eighth Unilever brand to gain the certification. The others are Ben & Jerry’s, Seventh Generation, Sir Kensington’s, Mãe Terra, Sundial, Olly Nutrition and Pukka Herbs.
Using growth for good
“B Corp accreditation reflects our mission to be leaders and agents for positive change in the tea category and industry at large,” says T2 Global CEO Nicole Sparshott.
“We consider our impact in every step of our business, from the first leaf to the last sip. Our mission is to continuously strive to do good across the business to ensure that all actions we take benefit both people and planet.”
Launched in Australia 20 years ago, T2 has since become a global brand, using its profits and growth to create a positive impact for employees, economies, communities and the environment.
Among its environmental achievements, T2 expects to source over 70% of tea ingredients from certified sustainable farms this year, with the balance on track to be certified sustainable in 2021.
Over 90% of T2 packaging is now recyclable, reusable or compostable, and the brand is on track to reach 100% in 2021. In fact, a shift to produce T2’s retail bags from uncoated paper without any plastic lamination, making them 100% recyclable, is diverting over 100 tonnes of waste from landfill annually.
Celebrating diversity to make a difference
T2 also extends its sustainability credentials to its people through its philosophy of celebrating difference by making a difference.
As part of its commitment to build a team that’s diverse in age, background and identify, the brand appointed specialist recruitment agencies and introduced a process known as ‘blind recruiting’. Job candidates are shortlisted without the hiring manager knowing an applicant’s name, date of birth, gender, educational institution or hiring appearance, to eliminate unconscious bias.
“We pride ourselves as a business that puts people first. By acknowledging our differences, we can reduce inequality, create healthier environments, build stronger communities and imbue jobs with dignity and purpose,” says Nicole.
text Unilever is part of a world-first pilot, funded by the UK government, that’s aiming to demonstrate how hydrogen fuel can be used as a low-carbon alternative to natural gas at an industrial scale.
Hydrogen has been recognised by the Committee on Climate Change – the UK’s independent climate advisory body – as an essential part of the journey to net-zero* and could be used for fuelling industry and transport networks, and heating homes.
Meeting climate targets
The pilot is based in the North West of England, where our Port Sunlight factory has been selected as one of three industrial sites – along with glass manufacturer Pilkington and the Essar Oil refinery – to prove the ‘fuel switch’ concept.
It forms part of a wider regional project called HyNet, which aims to help the UK’s transition to a decarbonised economy. With over two-thirds of local authorities in the UK declaring climate emergencies, hydrogen is increasingly being seen as part of the solution to meet local climate targets.
“Unilever has a clear target of being a carbon neutral company by 2030, and we’re committed to playing our part and doing what we can to help the wider industry move further, faster,” says Sebastian Munden, EVP & General Manager, Unilever UK & Ireland.
“We already have five carbon neutral sites in the UK, and have been able to reduce our manufacturing carbon footprint by two-thirds since 2008. The success of this Port Sunlight trial would mean Unilever is able to deliver home and personal care products to our consumers with an even smaller carbon footprint, which we know is of great importance to them.”
Pioneering technology
This pilot is one of two projects in the North West announced by the government. The second involves developing the UK’s first low-carbon hydrogen plant at Essar Oil’s Stanlow refinery. The plant will produce 3TWh (Terawatt-hour) of low-carbon hydrogen – doubling the UK’s total current biomethane production capacity – which will be provided to industrial and eventually domestic customers in the region. The success of these projects means that there could be low-carbon hydrogen blended into the gas grid and piped into homes and businesses by 2025.
The project also includes pioneering carbon capture technology, where over 95% of the carbon used in the process will be captured and stored in depleted gas fields in Liverpool Bay. When operational, the facility will capture 600,000 tonnes of CO2 per year – that’s equivalent to taking over 250,000 cars off the road.
World-firsts
The HyNet project will fund trials of hydrogen fuelling at Port Sunlight and at Pilkington’s Greengate Works plant in St Helens. The projects will aim to demonstrate that hydrogen can be used as a substitute fuel for natural gas in manufacturing processes, helping Unilever and Pilkington transition to a low-carbon future and leading the way for others to follow.
The demonstration at Port Sunlight will be the first meaningful use of hydrogen in a commercial scale boiler. The trial at Pilkington will be the first time that hydrogen is used in the glass-making process anywhere in the world. Evidence and learnings from both will pave the way for conversion to low-carbon hydrogen across a range of global industries.
The technical bit
The hydrogen will be produced by ‘reforming’ natural gas. This is a high-temperature process in which steam reacts with a hydrocarbon fuel to produce hydrogen. The resulting gas will be the same in composition as the low-carbon hydrogen to be produced by the HyNet project, which is known as ‘blue hydrogen’.
The technology and infrastructure developed as part of the programme will pave the way for the production and distribution of ‘green hydrogen’. This is gas that’s produced by a process called electrolysis (powered by renewables), which separates water into oxygen and hydrogen.
The Port Sunlight trial will help us gain knowledge and experience of using hydrogen as a fuel, which we can then apply globally. It also means we’ll have a hydrogen-enabled burner, which is ready to bring into operation when hydrogen becomes a commercially viable, low-carbon fuel source.
Our carbon neutral ambition
We want to play a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Since 2015, our Supply Chain and Procurement teams have been working hard to make progress by investing in clean technologies, increasing our energy efficiency and switching to renewable energy sources.
As of 1 January this year, all Unilever factories, offices, R&D facilities, data centres, warehouses and distribution centres – around the world – are now powered by 100% renewable grid electricity.
Our goal is to become a carbon neutral business by 2030. This will help us reduce operational costs, improve resilience in our energy supply and attract investors who are increasingly considering carbon risk.
The Paris Agreement could unlock $13.5 trillion in growth opportunities by 2030, as nearly 200 countries seek to accelerate their efforts to address climate change. By helping to build a business model that moves beyond a reliance on fossil fuels, we hope to benefit from the opportunities that new ways of doing business will create.
*Net-zero means that emissions are balanced by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, such as planting trees or using technology like carbon capture and storage.
text Every year, we recognise pioneering individuals within the company who have brought our values to life and truly embody what it means to be part of Unilever. Our 2019 Heroes with Impact have gone above and beyond their day-to-day jobs. Their stories paint a picture of passion, purpose and drive.
Do household products need harmful chemicals to be effective?
Following the conventional wisdom of the past, manufacturers accepted some harsh or environmentally ‘unfriendly’ chemicals as a necessary ingredient of cleaners and detergents.
Martin Wolf, Director of Sustainability and Authenticity at Seventh Generation, thought otherwise. “We have to consider the impacts we are having on the environment,” he says. “Phosphates were being used in cleaning products that went down the drain into lakes and streams, causing an environmental problem.”
The household care industry was largely in denial, as Martin explains. “Industry said, ‘yes, but if you take the phosphates out, then your washing machine and your dishwasher won’t work’.”
With two degrees in chemistry and over 40 years of experience in industrial and environmental chemistry, Martin was well placed to lead an alternative approach at Seventh Generation. This Vermont-based company, which joined the Unilever family in 2016, manufactures eco-friendly products in home and personal care.
The scienceman with a mission to heal the earth
At Seventh Generation, Martin is known as ‘Scienceman’ – a tribute to the impressive solutions he has developed with fellow chemists. “What Seventh Generation was able to do was show you could make a product without phosphates that cleans as well as a conventional brand,” he says.
Once state legislators saw that automatic dishwasher detergents without phosphates could work, they began passing phosphate bans in an effort to reverse eutrophication – an excessive richness of nutrients – in local lakes, rivers and streams. After several states had passed such legislation, the industry voluntarily agreed to stop using phosphates throughout the US.
But this is just one part of the impact that Martin has had. Complementing his role as a scientist, he has been active as an advocate for sustainability for over a decade. Working with other companies in the cleaning products industry, Martin helped develop criteria for more sustainable products that have been adopted by much of the consumer packaged goods industry and by many retailers in the US. These criteria now serve as a basis for retailers to evaluate products and their manufacturers using a common reporting platform.
Disclosure of ingredients
Working with others at Seventh Generation, Martin has advocated for complete disclosure of ingredients in cleaning products. “Most people don’t realise that in the US, complete ingredient disclosure is required for food and personal care products, but not for cleaning products,” he says.
Martin again worked with industry associations to create a voluntary disclosure programme in 2010 and collaborated with NGOs and other companies to pass the California Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2017. “If companies choose to include harsh or hazardous chemicals in their products, they should inform the product user so the user can decide if they are comfortable using the product,” he explains.
The American Cleaning Institute (ACI) – of which Unilever is a member – is the trade association representing the cleaning products industry in the US. Martin worked within the Institute to make sustainability central to the industry. He brought his powerful presence to the strategic advisory, regulatory, sustainability and consumer outreach programmes of the ACI, chairing three of its committees. The ACI has recognised him with a distinguished service award.
His advocacy has produced tangible results, bringing wide benefits to society. In 2014, he supported the Toxic-Free Families Act in Vermont, which protects children from toxic chemicals in products like toys and car seats. He is now working to reduce plastic waste and create a circular economy in which no material is ever perceived as waste.
Martin’s activities within the company and the industry embody Seventh Generation’s mission to leave the planet in the best possible state for generations to come. “I have as a personal purpose the goal of healing the earth and seeking justice,” he says – words that are as inspiring as his actions.
text Suave has become the latest of Unilever’s beauty and personal care brands to gain global ‘cruelty-free’ accreditation from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
Found in one in every two homes in the US, a Suave product is sold every 14 seconds, demonstrating that quality, value and safe products that do not require animal testing can be accessible to all.
“We are delighted to be part of PETA’s ‘Beauty Without Bunnies’ programme,” says Berengere Loubatier, Suave’s Senior Brand Director.
“Suave is known for its high-quality beauty products made accessible to all since 1937. Our consumers care about animals and so do we! That is why we are proud to be certified cruelty-free by PETA and continue to offer high-quality beauty products.”
“Millions of PETA supporters and consumers everywhere will be delighted by this news,” adds PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo. “PETA welcomes Suave and thanks Unilever for its commitment to ending tests on animals everywhere.”
Collaborating to end animal testing
Unilever is one of just five companies to be listed by PETA as a company ‘working for regulatory change’ and Suave joins a growing number of Unilever brands to have gained its ‘cruelty-free’ accreditation. Over the last 18 months, Dove, Simple, St. Ives, Love Beauty and Planet, and Love Home and Planet have also been added to PETA’s ‘Beauty Without Bunnies’ certified list.
Scientists at our Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre (SEAC) use cell-based and computer models to assess product safety instead of animal methods, and for more than 30 years we have been collaborating with leading scientists and policy makers to facilitate the adoption of such approaches.
Julia Fentem, Head of SEAC, says: “Unilever supports calls for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics and Suave becoming PETA-accredited is another important proof point of our commitment.”
In 2018, Unilever entered into a multi-year, open collaboration with the Humane Society International (HSI). Together we’re supporting company and regulatory scientists globally to build capability in alternatives to animal testing, so that safety decisions for cosmetics can all be based on non-animal approaches. The partnership also invests in training future safety scientists in ‘next generation’ risk assessment that doesn’t use animals, to ensure long-term change.
Unilever recently received the Humane Society’s Corporate Consciousness Award at its 2019 To the Rescue! 10th Anniversary Gala. The honour marked Unilever's global industry leadership to end animal testing and long history of collaboration with HSI.
PETA’s ‘Cruelty-Free’ logo will appear on Suave’s packaging soon, to assure shoppers that it does not and will not test on animals anywhere in the world.
text Unilever is providing hygiene kits for guests and hygiene education and products for hospitality workers at select OYO properties in India, as part of the homes and hotels company’s ‘Sanitised Stays’ initiative.
With rigorous cleaning standards, minimal-touch services and enhanced credibility topping the list of customer requirements in the hospitality industry during the Covid-19 pandemic, OYO and Unilever’s partnership will first roll out in India before extending to OYO’s properties in other countries across South East Asia, Europe, the US and South America.
Selected OYO properties will provide products from our Lifebuoy, Domex (Domestos), Sunlight and Cif brands to both staff and guests, which can create a cleaner and more hygienic experience from check-in to check-out.
OYO is creating new standards for cleaning with the help of our R&D team that will include the correct use of Unilever products. Among the protocols are deep-cleaning and disinfecting high-touch zones in rooms, such as door handles, phones, light switches and all hard surfaces. Common areas, including elevators, registration desks and dining rooms, will be cleaned at least four times a day.
Alcohol-based hand gel will be made available for guests at all key entrances, exits and high-traffic areas too.
Trusted brands and education
“We are pleased to be partnering with OYO to provide our products as some parts of the world start to get back up and running,” says Nitin Paranjpe, Chief Operating Officer, Unilever.
“As we learn to adjust, hygiene and cleanliness are paramount to keeping ourselves and each other safe. Unilever is pleased to be able to help and provide OYO’s guests with some of our most trusted brands,” Nitin adds.
“With Hindustan Unilever’s long history in India, we are determined to do our part to protect lives and livelihoods, and are glad to have found a strong partner in OYO who shares this vision,” says Sanjiv Mehta, Chair and Managing Director of Hindustan Unilever.
“Through this partnership, Unilever is pleased to be able to help, through our known and trusted home and personal hygiene brands and education on their correct use. We remain committed to improving the health and wellbeing of millions across the globe and keeping our communities safe during these times,” he adds.
Ritesh Agarwal, Founder & Group CEO, OYO says: “As the world begins to travel again, we must all collectively ensure that health and safety remain the absolute priority.
“We’re pleased that by partnering with Unilever and providing their trusted products, we are able to help customers, as well as our staff, stay as safe as possible. With our committed asset owners, we are ready to host consumers across the world and we promise to give our customers the confidence to enjoy the OYO experience as we help drive higher standards in hygiene.”

text With hundreds of millions of people around the globe in lockdown or tentatively getting back to a ‘new normal’, household care and laundry products are in high demand. Cleaning and disinfecting our homes and clothes has jumped in priority as we look to protect ourselves and our families.
People have more than doubled how often they clean, with 86% changing the way they clean their homes and 66% changing the way they wash their clothes.
They are also looking for more help and advice, particularly online. There has been a 40% increase in traffic to the Cleanipedia website, which gives cleaning tips and advice on how to clean your house.
Unilever has some of the world’s most recognisable – and effective – bleach, surface cleaner and laundry detergent brands. Household names like Domestos, Cif and OMO.
And since our products are used every day by over a billion consumers in 190 countries, we’re using that scale and reach to help people not only get access to the products they need, but also allay their concerns when it comes to the rights and wrongs of cleaning protection.
“The pandemic has been a reminder to the world just how important hygiene is and, as a business, we were founded on the mission to make hygiene commonplace,” says Peter ter Kulve, President of our Home Care division.
“Our brands, suppliers and partners around the world have been working at a record pace to ensure we not only provide essential products to people, but that we add benefit to their lives too. From public awareness campaigns, to launching new antibacterial ranges, to helping the most vulnerable, our brands have shown the true power when we all come together.”
text Here’s a few stats to get your head in a spin. The average Brazilian family does three to five loads of laundry each week. If you consider that each load takes between four to five hours from wash to dry, that’s way more time than most people want to spend on dirty socks and their laundry basket.
Hours wasted is not the only factor making people look to outsource laundry responsibilities.
Companies such as Airbnb and Uber which have emerged during the lifetime of millennials mean wide acceptance of a business model where private individuals are happy to share assets and services.
This sharing economy means “people, especially young people, are more comfortable with accessing goods rather than owning them,” as Christoph Lutz, Associate Professor of Communication and Culture at BI Norwegian Business School, explains to Businessbecause.com.
Why buy when you can share?
If your mindset is ‘why buy a car when you can grab an uber?’ it doesn’t take a massive leap to think ‘why buy a washing machine when you can get your clothes cleaned at a launderette?’
These are just two of the factors making Omo Brazil’s Business Development Director Teo Figueiredo excited by the laundry brand’s recent acquisition of the Acerte Group’s chain of 123 franchised laundromats and ‘express’ tailors.
He also adds one more. “There’s a considerable sustainability angle to having your washing done by a laundry service provider,” he says.
How green is your machine?
“Commercial top-loading washing machines hold more clothes and use up to 72% less energy and water than front-loading household machines,” Teo explains. “The average residential washing machine uses 120 litres of water per cycle, our machines use 40 – and that’s a considerable water saving, not just for the planet but for Brazilian households that pay for their water supply.
“Instead of spending four to five hours taking clothes from wash to dry,” he continues, “our machines have your washing ready in 75 minutes. They use 2kW of energy per cycle, smaller household machines use 9kW.”
Less is more
Larger loads can save detergent and cut back on plastic too. “Most people overwash clothes and add too much detergent to machines which can really impact an individual’s carbon footprint,” says Teo. “If all your laundry was service washed by a professional provider, you’d reduce your plastic consumption by 10kg a year.”
Not just the machine but what goes in it
And it’s not just the process that can be more sustainable, having clothes properly laundered can add to their lifespan in people’s wardrobes. According to consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale who is quoted in the Guardian newspaper, as more people invest in sustainable clothing, “going to a laundry run by a trusted brand that produces quality products means, by association, that your products will be safe”.
The Acerte stores are currently in the process of being rebranded as Omo launderettes, the first one is customer ready, and 15 stores have been sold to licensed franchisees.
The launch of an app is imminent. It will allow customers to have their washing collected and returned freshly laundered to their door. Teo expects the app launch to be followed by an increase in franchisee and customer interest, as it provides minimal social contact and access to professional cleaning services while the public continues to live with the threat of Covid-19.
So what should we expect from Omo launderettes in five years’ time? “The idea,” says Unilever Brazil’s Vice President of Marketing, Eduardo Campanella, “is to have the largest franchise in the sector – taking numbers from 123 to 500 stores.” And the ambition doesn’t stop there – the franchise has potential to roll out to the other 162 countries where Unilever is present and where people are keen for more me-time away from household chores.
text Here’s a welcome addition to the ‘new normal’ – Unilever’s flexible working programme has gained some extra flex. Beyond where you work and how you work, colleagues can now use, test or grow their skill sets, assisting on new projects around the business.
There’s no time wasted looking for placements suit to their CVs, either. Instead, the Flex Experiences platform uses AI to match the right people with the right project opportunities, fast.
HR Business Partner Yanpi Oliveros-Pascual has worked with Flex’s roll-out across 100+ countries to 60,000+ employees. “Unilever encourages all employees to create capability through lifelong learning. Flex allows our employees to work on projects for a small or large proportion of time, increase the depth of their current skills or build new skills and experiences in a flexible way. We believe that our people are much more than their job title. If our people thrive, we thrive as a business,” she says.
Flex has come into its own in the past three months when business agility became critical for business continuity. Covid-19 saw the world lock down. Unilever’s marketing plans, supply chain, logistics and product manufacture all needed to work at speed to respond to evolving consumer needs and expectations.
For Data Science Director Giles Pavey, that meant getting information and analytics (I&A) out to the front line to help teams respond to changes as the virus spread. “We wanted to look at internal data on sales, cash and supply chain and compare them to the external factors such as infection rate and changing consumer behaviour,” he says.
He turned to Flex to help him supercharge his team of data and analytic experts – building a Covid-19 I&A Squad. The start date was ASAP. “We were looking for people from a diverse set of backgrounds, experts from a variety of markets and with a variety of functional expertise,” he says. “We asked for data scientists, business analysts, project managers, Agile experts and user-experience designers.”
CVs came in quickly. “We know that Unilever has talent, but we were pleasantly surprised by the energy people displayed,” he says.
Putting existing skills to use, testing new ones
Port Sunlight-based David Southgate was one of the first to apply. “I’d seen many examples of people stepping up inside and outside work to tackle the pandemic. I wanted to do something to help. Putting my CV forward felt like the perfect opportunity. I could help the business by using skills I already had. I talked to my line manager and committed to giving the project two days a week alongside my day job.”
The project was set up across 12 workstreams with five priority pillars: demand, supply, cash flow, people and community. “I led the UK market insights workstream,” says David, “to provide answers and analytics to business questions on market performance.”
Being part of the Covid-19 I&A squad offered him more than an opportunity to help Unilever manage its response to the pandemic. “I’m currently undertaking a data fellowship programme to become a data scientist, and this project allowed me to get my hands dirty on new datasets and put my new skills to the test,” he says.
“More importantly,” he adds, “to really understand the data and the patterns, I have had to reach out to a number of colleagues in finance, supply chain and CMI and this has helped me gain a better understanding of the business outside my normal role, especially in the UKI market.”
A chance to employ fresh thinking
Ana Huerzeler, Category Food Manager at Unilever Food Solutions (UFS), put her name forward for a Flex opportunity to help develop a global marketing and PR plan for our newly acquired brand, The Vegetarian Butcher.
“I’ve been part of the Vegetarian Butcher global team at UFS since last October, working on general brand development, roll-out to different countries and innovations,” she explains. “I was really interested in finding out about the communications side and my category director, Frank Galestien, was really supportive in giving me time to work on this for a few months.”
For Ana, knowledge of both the consumer-facing and business-to-business sides of Unilever Foods & Refreshment allowed her to bring an understanding of the differences and similarities between the channels and markets to the project. “I’m enjoying the process of learning something new while building on the foundation of past experiences,” she says.
What began as a Flex assignment has moved forward, too. “In scoping out the project we started to understand that we needed more in-depth resource in branding and category,” says Frank. “It needed more time than the few months that we had had for the Flex project. We needed to onboard someone, and that someone was Ana.”
Both Ana and David are clear that their positive Flex experiences start with supportive line managers. “Frank understood how this opportunity could help use my skills, help me develop new ones and meet my own growth ambitions. It has been the perfect learning opportunity for me,” Ana says.
“Managing two roles can be challenging,” adds David, “so it’s important to come to an arrangement with your line manager to manage your time before applying.”
But both sides of the Flex equation – project leaders as well as the candidates – see the value Flex offers on a business and personal level. “We would not have been able to respond as fully without it,” says Giles. “It’s a great way of lining up I&A’s demand for quality resource and fulfilling candidates’ demand for new experiences in and exciting skill area, which I&A can supply.”
text Deep in the heart of Shanghai’s business district is a new Unilever hub that is set to transform the speed with which we bring products to market for Chinese consumers.
It’s the brainchild of a small group of Unilever’s R&D experts including Senior R&D Manager for Skin Care Jason Wei and Global Skin Care Digital Processing Manager Jake Onyett, who currently manage the space.
Known as the AI hub, it shares its name with the Chinese character for love 爱. The name reflects its status as a centre for artificial intelligence and acknowledges the agility and innovation expected to go on inside the building’s four walls.
“There’s room for three to four teams to work in parallel, as well as space for consumers and stakeholders during workshops,” says Jake. “But the aim is to keep the space and the number of people who work here is entirely agile.”
The facility has been designed to ramp up the speed of product innovation ‘in China and for China’, from several months to a matter of minutes.
State-of-the-art hardware helps to make this happen. High-performance computers are equipped with modelling software to develop product concepts, create 3D packaging designs and ready prototypes to test with consumers. And Unilever can call on a global talent pool of data analysts, modellers and engineers who can work remotely or in the hub to bring project ideas to life.
Live-stream local market and consumer data are helping fast-track ideas into products that deliver long-term value
Using live data to find new product ideas
Impressive stuff, but the real magic happens when real-time local market and consumer data are added to the mix. The facility can live-stream seven-screen projections at the same time. “In China live-streaming has become a huge sensation in e-commerce,” says Jake. The information these streams provide will be used to turn ideas into products that deliver long-term superior value for both consumers and the business.
“The idea is to link real-time consumer/market data to capture and predict trends, identify opportunities and leverage digital tools to rapidly create prototypes to help us launch faster and smarter,” explains Jason. “For example, if we find by listening to social media that a face mask for acne is a sizeable business opportunity for skin care, we could use R&D simulation tools to decide how we proceed with this project.”
And that’s not the most exciting part. “We can then engage with consumers to design products with them, not just for them,” he says. Teams can run consumer workshops to test products before launch, with the AI hub acting like a digitally enabled ‘lounge’ where consumers can experience new concepts, using tools such as augmented and virtual reality and then share their thoughts on these products instantly.
Add this insight and understanding to the hub’s R&D capabilities to produce a customised demo and it becomes clear that Jason’s vision to “to create new end-to-end products in minutes” is more than just blue-sky thinking.
Virtual tools will become a ‘new normal’ for innovation
The AI hub was officially opened on 17 June by CEO Alan Jope and Head of R&D Richard Slater alongside North Asia R&D VP Peter Schrooyen and North Asia EVP Rohit Jawa.
While Covid-19 has thrown up a lot of challenges, it has also shown the need for the ability to run things virtually. “The AI hub workflow doesn’t have to be restricted to the physical hub,” says Jake.
The fact that much of the centre’s capabilities can be accessed remotely has meant a semblance of business as usual even when restrictions around the world resulting from Covid-19 are still in place.
Having the ability to share prototypes and concepts instantly through virtual tools will drastically reduce our innovation timelines,” Jake says. “It’ll be a key part of the process, even more so in the post-Covid-19 ‘new normal’.”
“I genuinely believe this is the future so I’m incredibly excited to be a part of it,” he adds. “The AI hub takes the best of both scenarios, working as small agile teams with full autonomy but fully equipped with the resources of Unilever. It’s a recipe for the next generation of amazing product development.”
text Today, we have officially opened a new state-of-the-art global Foods Innovation Centre in the Netherlands.
It’s called Hive and it’s located on the Wageningen Campus, the world’s most renowned and respected agri-food ecosystem.
Hive is a high-tech facility with 18,000m2 of collaboration space, a pilot plant, a customer experience area, five test kitchens, and two levels of laboratories and offices.
The building has been designed so our research and development teams can co-create with partners, customers and consumers, while tapping into the campus’s network of start-ups, knowledge institutes and academics.
As Manfred Aben, Vice President R&D and Head of the Foods Innovation Centre, says: “Hive will allow a more open, revolutionary way of co-working. By bringing all these people together in one vibrant and inspiring innovation powerhouse, we can turn bright ideas into the healthy, sustainable foods of the future.”
The Centre, which was opened by His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, will be the focal point for innovation activity across all our food brands including Knorr, Hellmann’s, The Vegetarian Butcher and Calvé.
Hive will allow a more open, revolutionary way of co-working, bringing people together in one vibrant and inspiring innovation powerhouse. Manfred Aben 
Built with sustainability in mind
As you’d expect from a building that will be home to people working on the very future of food, it was designed and built with sustainability and circularity at its core.
Hive is energy neutral, powered by over 1,800 solar panels with daylight maximised to help reduce overall energy consumption. It incorporates an innovative way of filtering air to improve health. And rainwater is harvested to use in the gardens and washrooms. Wherever possible, the building parts come from recycled or sustainable origins and are designed to be reused in the future.
It’s a perfect illustration of what sustainable architecture actually means in practice. So much so, it has received the BREEAM Outstanding Certification and two BREEAM awards for sustainable design. BREEAM is the world's leading independent sustainability assessment method.
A gathering of experts
To mark the opening of Hive, we hosted a symposium on Foods as a Force for Good. Experts from the foods industry, government organisations and NGOs gathered to discuss how innovation and technology can transform the foods sector towards a healthy and sustainable system.
Three panel sessions covered: the opportunities to create a more inclusive, sustainable and efficient system that’s better for the planet; the actions required to help people eat more nutritious foods; and the partnerships and investments needed to speed up innovation and technology for foods systems transformation.
Guest speakers included: Mette Lykke, CEO of Too Good To Go; Diane Holdorf, Managing Director of Food and Nature at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development; Louise Fresco, President of Wageningen University & Research; and Bertrand Swiderski, Chief Sustainability Officer at Carrefour.
These partnerships will catalyse new solutions for the foods of tomorrow and demonstrate that change at scale is achievable. Alan Jope 
The need for speed
As one of the largest consumer goods companies in the world, we’re mindful of how we must play our part in helping address the enormous challenges faced by the global food system.
By 2050, more than 9 billion people will need 70% more food than is consumed today. And over 2 billion people will lack the food they need.
Obesity has more than doubled worldwide since 1980. And yet, every year tonnes of food doesn’t even make it onto the shelves. It’s lost to poor logistics or inadequate storage.
Then there’s all the food that never gets eaten. Consumers in industrialised countries throw out the equivalent amount of food per year as sub-Saharan Africa’s entire annual harvest. And this in a world where 800 million people still go to bed hungry every night.
Clearly, something has to change – and this is where the scale and reach of our brands can play a role.
We want to live up to our mission to create products that taste good, make people feel good, and are a true force for good, whether that’s through cutting sugar and calories, or introducing more plant-based options.
"We need a fundamental transformation of the food system if we want to make a genuine difference and feed more than 9 billion people sustainably and nutritiously,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “Malnutrition, obesity, climate change and food waste are issues that can only be addressed if we work in partnership to accelerate technology and innovation."
“The unique location of the Global Foods Innovation Centre enables Unilever to step up our engagement with Wageningen University & Research and a broad variety of science institutes, start-ups, NGOs and other companies in the foods sector. These partnerships will catalyse new solutions for the foods of tomorrow and demonstrate that change at scale is achievable.”
text We are delighted to be once again ranked as the global leader in corporate sustainability in the annual survey compiled by GlobeScan and SustainAbility.
This survey canvasses the opinions of experts from business, government, NGOs and academia. Its aim is to track how the sustainability agenda is evolving and find out stakeholders’ views on which companies are leaders and why.
This year, more than 700 experts in over 70 countries were asked, unprompted, to name companies that they see as being leaders in integrating sustainability into their business strategy.
We were mentioned by 42% of those who responded – that’s up five points on our 2019 score.
Also featuring on this year’s list are Patagonia (26%) and IKEA (14%), followed by Interface and Natura, both on 8%.
GlobeScan also analyses the scores by region. Unilever, Patagonia and IKEA take the 1-2-3 spots in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In Africa, we’re top, but Anglo American comes in second, ahead of Patagonia. In Latin America, home-grown cosmetics company Natura is No.1, with Unilever second and IKEA third.
As Chief Sustainability Officer Rebecca Marmot says: “This geographic spread of leadership is a notable step-change from previous years. It indicates that our strategy to democratise sustainability through our Compass is being recognised externally on the ground where it really matters.”
Read the full report
Proud of our achievements, but more to do
We first rose to the top of the GlobeScan survey in 2011, just a few months after we launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP).
The Plan’s 2020 targets were to improve the health of 1 billion people, buy 100% of our agricultural materials from sustainable sources and halve the environmental impact of our products.
At the time, GlobeScan’s Senior Vice President Chris Coulter said of our ambitions: “The stakes for sustainability leadership have been raised to a new level.”
So, how have we done against those goals?
In the ten years of the Plan, we've seen the way our work has changed the world around us – empowering women, protecting forests, improving health and supporting sustainable farming.
For instance, we helped more than 1.3 billion people improve their health and hygiene. We increased the amount of our agricultural raw materials that are sustainably sourced from 14% to 62%. And we are now using 100% renewable grid electricity in our manufacturing operations worldwide.
We also empowered over 2.3 million women, supporting them to develop new skills and expand their opportunities. And we helped 1.8 million small-scale retailers around the world access initiatives to improve their income.
We’re proud of our achievements, but we know we still have a lot of work to do.
An even more ambitious strategy
We haven’t met every one of our USLP targets. And at times, we’ve learnt some hard lessons. We’re taking these learnings and putting them at the heart of a new, even more ambitious strategy.
For instance, we found it difficult to maintain and deliver our sustainable sourcing targets when we don’t have full visibility of the supply chain for some ingredients. However much time and money we invest, we’re not always going to be able to deliver a more sustainable crop. So, we’re focusing on the ingredients where we can have the greatest impact.
Similarly, we found it difficult to measure the actual impact of many of our programmes to improve livelihoods and enhance opportunities for women. This is something we’re still working on.
We also found that because the pace of change is fast, we need to be flexible to stay ahead of the curve. We realised, for example, that our work on waste had to be accelerated to address plastic specifically. We introduced new commitments in 2017, followed by very stretching targets in 2019.
And in June, we launched ambitious new commitments and actions to fight climate change, protect and regenerate nature, and preserve resources for future generations. These include net zero emissions from all our products by 2039 and a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023.
“Our vision is to be the leader in sustainable business globally,” says Rebecca. “We want to be a business that delivers value to all stakeholders – socially, environmentally and economically. We will do more of what has worked well and correct what hasn’t. And we’ll continue to set ourselves even more ambitious and progressive targets.”
text Last year, Magnum was the first ice cream brand to pioneer a new recycling technology and the first to use recycled plastic within the ice cream industry.
Designed to tackle the impact plastic has on the environment, Magnum’s new tubs and lids for its pints range are fully recyclable and made with recycled polypropylene plastic (rPP).
The advanced recycling technology that makes this possible transforms previously unrecyclable plastic waste into a valuable resource. The rPP waste can be re-processed infinitely, as the closed-loop recycling method preserves the quality of the material, thus reducing the need for virgin plastic.
Initially, 600,000 of the new tubs were launched in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain in 2019. This year, more than 7 million will be introduced across other European countries. And from 2021 onwards, the new packs will be rolled out globally.
By the end of 2020, all Magnum Pints tubs in Europe will be produced with rPP, which means over 160,000 kilograms of recycled plastic. Our goal is that, by 2025, all Magnum tubs will be made with recycled plastic. The full roll-out across all European countries is another exciting step towards a more sustainable future.
As Julien Barraux, Global VP for Magnum, says, “We are proud to be one of the world’s first ice cream brands to pioneer this ground-breaking technology. Through this new approach, we hope to lead the food and refreshment industry towards a more sustainable future, paving the way to a circular economy.
These days, consumers – rightly – expect all packaging to be sustainable. By keeping our plastic material in the loop, we are contributing to a healthier planet and preventing plastic pollution.
With more in-home consumption due to Covid-19, the introduction of these tubs and their reduced impact on the environment becomes even more relevant as the world prepares for a new future.”
A process didn’t exist, so we helped develop one
Although there have been rPP options available for beauty and personal care products for some time, there were previously no solutions approved for use in food-grade packaging. So, we collaborated with SABIC – a global leader in diversified chemicals – to develop one.
The rPP used in Magnum is not obtained by traditional mechanical recycling, as this is not suitable for food contact packaging. We use an innovative recycling process that transforms the plastic waste into a resin with the same characteristics as virgin food-grade resin.
This new technology allows us to recycle low quality, mixed plastic waste that would otherwise most likely be destined for incineration or landfill. It is not currently possible to produce food-grade rPP with any other form of recycling system.
The move is part of Unilever’s wider global packaging commitment to halve the company’s use of virgin plastic by reducing its absolute use of plastic packaging by more than 100,000 tonnes and accelerating its use of recycled plastic by 2025.
Plastic has its place, but that place is not in the environment
The rate at which we are currently using the world’s resources means that, before long, they will simply run out. We need to not only build recycling into our everyday routine, but also focus on new technology, to reduce the use of plastics as a matter of urgency.
The circular economy aims to change how we make, use and ultimately dispose of materials. It ensures that the world can continue to support the needs of a growing population while, at the same time, reversing our current unsustainable levels of pollution.
Plastic is a valuable material. It is crucial for the safe and efficient distribution of products, and it has a lower carbon footprint than many alternative materials. So, it has its place. That place is inside the circular economy – where it is reused, recycled or composted. And where it is kept in a loop, to stop it from ever finding its way into the environment.
text Unilever Brazil is working with Heineken, the country’s second-largest brewing company, to manufacture a special batch of Cif household cleaner. This is being donated to people who live in some of São Paulo’s most socially vulnerable shanty towns, or favelas.
We are producing a run of 270,000 bottles of the alcohol-based sanitiser to distribute to families in 210 favelas. It is hoped the product will benefit around 2 million residents in total, helping them protect their homes against the spread of Covid-19.
The virus is capable of surviving for several days on some surfaces, particularly those that can be easily contaminated such as door handles, tabletops and kitchen counters.
Cif Higienizador + Álcool (Sanitiser + Alcohol) is designed to clean and disinfect all types of surfaces, and the on-pack instructions encourage people to take the necessary preventive measures in the home.
The special edition product – which we took from initial idea to production in just 20 days – is being made with alcohol from the Heineken brewery and the bactericide used in Cif.
A network of partners pulling together
After Heineken agreed to donate the alcohol from its alcohol-free beer production process, the first job was for our R&D team to work on a formulation for the product. Alcohol from the brewing process has slightly different properties to the type we usually use as an ingredient.
Next, we identified and co-ordinated third parties who could supply the bottles, caps and labels, and a manufacturer we could work with on the production itself.
In addition to Heineken, there are eight partner organisations involved. The bottles are produced by PQS and BrasALPLA. Universal Chemical runs the production. Westrock supplies the cartons for transport, Alemolde the bottle lids and CCL the labels. CRX Design and Trident developed the artwork. The favela support group CUFA (Central Única das Favelas) is distributing the product.
All these organisations are donating their time, expertise or materials free of charge.
It is amazing to see the involvement of all these partners. It’s a real opportunity to do something for people in need during these uncertain times. Yasmine Antacli 
We can achieve more by working together
Yasmine Antacli, our Director of Marketing in Brazil, says: “It is amazing to see the involvement of all these partners. It’s a real opportunity for small companies – who want to help but didn’t know how – to do something for people in need during these uncertain times.
“The idea was born from a conversation with Heineken. The marketing team then took the lead to connect all the Unilever functions and, in a few days, we had all the suppliers engaged.”
“More than ever, joint effort is necessary to help us get through such a difficult situation,” adds Eduardo Campanella, our VP of Marketing in Brazil. “Through this initiative, we have secured the participation of suppliers and partners genuinely intent on helping tackle the spread of this disease and protect public health. The project clearly shows how, by working together, we can achieve more.”
In parallel with distributing Cif Higienizador + Álcool to those families identified as most vulnerable, we are also assessing the feasibility of a second production run with our partners.
text Our end-to-end business is dependent on continued access to water. Whether that’s our farmers and raw material suppliers; our manufacturing sites or consumers who need water to enjoy our products to do their laundry or make a cup of tea.
Earlier this month UN-Water, which co-ordinates the United Nation’s response on water and sanitation, announced that the world was “alarmingly off-track” in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) that looks to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.
Far too many people still do not have their basic water needs met. Worldwide, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water. Two out of five do not have basic handwashing facilities and more than 673 million people still practice open defecation. Today, water insecurity affects 40% of the global population and is projected to rise into the future.
Covid-19 has taught us that access to water is fundamental for people to maintain healthy lives. It has also taught us that fighting a major crisis – such as a global pandemic – requires collective action with other businesses, civil society and governments to create change at scale.
What water stewardship means to us
Stewardship is about taking responsibility for something you don’t own. For Unilever, water stewardship is about taking action to counteract the impact from our products and operations, and about working with others to strengthen the whole system. It’s about the ways we can use water that enables everyone not just to survive, but to thrive.
Three water goals by 2030
Over the past ten years, we have made conscious decisions, as part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), to reduce our manufacturing water footprint. And to date, we’ve achieved a 47% reduction, on an intensity and an absolute basis, exceeding our 2020 target by 7%. But we recognise there is more to do.
That’s why in June this year, Unilever set out a new range of measures and commitments to fight climate change and protect and regenerate nature to preserve the planet’s resources for future generations.
As part of our commitments around water, we announced that by 2030 we would:
make our product formulations biodegradable
implement water stewardship programmes around 100 Unilever manufacturing sites in water-stressed locations
join the 2030 Water Resources Group (WRG) to contribute to transformative change and build water management resilience in key water-stressed countries.
To help us realise these goals, we will work with two new partners. The 2030 Water Resources Group (2030 WRG) will see us engage in collective action to achieve water security for all by 2030. The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) will guide our water-stressed manufacturing sites to address water risks beyond factory walls by collaborating with other stakeholders in the shared water catchment area.
Changing the way the world uses water – one country at a time
Hosted by The World Bank, the 2030 WRG’s ambition is to use the power of public–private partnerships – what we call multi-stakeholder platforms – to create water resilience for economies and societies that face serious water challenges.
“We all know water is critical for lives and livelihoods; yet we are wasting it, polluting it, and taking it for granted. We need collective action to solve a water crisis that is wreaking havoc in villages, towns and cities across our planet,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope. “Unilever is stepping up its action on water and we look forward to working with the 2030 Water Resources Group for bigger, broader impact.”
The 2030 WRG programmes are data-driven and see roadmaps put in place at the request of senior levels of government to help establish long-term water security at a country or state level. It’s a big ambition, but water security is a big problem that needs big changes.
“We have an opportunity to be part of the current regenerative business movement that has a focus on systems thinking to protect, restore and replenish both human capital and natural resources,” says World Bank VP for Sustainable Development, and 2030 WRG Governing Council Co-Chair Juergen Voegele.
“With growing water scarcity challenges, exacerbated by climate change, it is more critical than ever for stakeholders to join forces to advance water security outcomes,” he says. “We are delighted to welcome Unilever as a global 2030 WRG partner, with its core commitment to the principles of water sustainability, equitable access and livelihood security.”
And the work has already begun. In Bangladesh, Unilever has collaborated with the 2030 WRG, alongside the Red Crescent Society, to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at Deputy Commissioner offices in 64 districts, and conduct a nationwide public education campaign on handwashing and hygiene with the aim of reaching 20 million people.
Changing the way Unilever and other businesses use water
Our second partnership sees us joining the Alliance for Water Stewardship, an organisation whose globally recognised framework for water stewardship, the AWS Standard, helps major water users understand their own water dependencies and impacts.
As a funding member, we are trialling the AWS Standard in select water-stressed sites, and will be looking to codify and build it into our existing processes and procedures.
We are also building on existing experience in addressing water-related issues through our Hindustan Unilever Foundation and the Prabhat programme which has been implemented in eight manufacturing sites to address gaps in water supply and demand in India.
In the six years it’s been active, the programme has helped 2.95 million people through projects such as building irrigation systems, organising rainwater collection, and helping local farmers select water-efficient crops. All of which has resulted in 12 billion litres of additional water supply, 22 billion litres of water savings, and more than 18,000 tonnes of additional agricultural yield.
Adrian Sym, CEO at the Alliance for Water Stewardship, says: “We greatly welcome Unilever as a funding member of AWS. Having witnessed projects implemented by the Hindustan Unilever Foundation, I have a deep respect for how their work builds trusting relationships with communities. We are excited about the expertise, knowledge and experience that Unilever can bring to help our members improve water stewardship practice.”
text For over 100 years, families around the world have trusted Lifebuoy to help keep germs at bay. Now, with hygiene a greater priority than ever, the brand is coming back to where it started: the United Kingdom.
Back in 1894, Lifebuoy soap was created to help combat the disease and infection that ran rife in towns across Victorian England as a result of rapid urbanisation.
At the time, a cholera epidemic prevailed and in Lifebuoy soap, Unilever founder William Lever provided an affordable, accessible way for communities to help protect themselves from the spread of disease.
The brand’s long-standing mission to raise awareness of the importance of using soap in handwashing was reinforced through advertising, on-pack messages and local campaigning. And washing hands with Lifebuoy soap to help reduce the spread of germs was soon a habit for many.
Lifebuoy became not just one of the world’s first consumer brands, but also an agent of social change.
A brand trusted by billions
Much has changed in the years since then. The cholera pandemic passed, but in 1918 the Spanish flu followed. Years later, so did SARS, the H1N1 flu, and now Covid-19.
Meanwhile, Lifebuoy has gone global and is now sold in over 50 countries. It’s grown to become the world’s number one selling hygiene soap brand,1 and its campaigns to promote the power of handwashing with soap to help reduce the spread of germs have reached more than 1 billion people.
But that mission – to protect people by inspiring good handwashing habits – remains the same.
Over a century since its launch, Lifebuoy is still trusted by families all over the world. And that’s why it’s now coming back to the UK, where it all started.
New products and a new educational campaign
Lifebuoy is re-introducing its Classic Red Bar Soap to stores across the UK from August, along with some new members of the family.
Lifebuoy’s 2020 line-up will also comprise Hand Sanitiser Gel, Hand Hygiene Wipes, Hand Sanitiser Spray, Liquid Handwash and Moisturising Hand Cream + Anti-bac – a hydrating cream enriched with antibacterial ingredients.
And it’s not just the products that are set to make an impact. Lifebuoy is introducing sanitation stations in stores, cafés and cinemas too, making it easy for the British public to keep their hands clean as they begin a cautious return to the new normality.
Lifebuoy is also adapting its behaviour-change campaign for UK audiences.
The campaign – which has reached a vast international audience with messages about the importance of handwashing with soap and the most effective ways and times to do it – will be delivered in more than 4,000 UK schools from September. It’s a move set to reach more than 1 million children and their families.
Thousands of children will also be provided with products and kits filled with information about how to make good handwashing part of everyday life. And free digital kits will be available for anyone to download.
All materials draw on Lifebuoy’s expertise and experience. And to ensure the brand provides the most credible advice, Lifebuoy has worked closely with external experts – including specialists from the Royal Society of Public Health (RSPH) – to create the UK programme.
On a mission to improve handwashing habits
“For over a century, Lifebuoy has played a crucial role in helping to reduce the spread of infection. As well as getting our products to communities, we are on a mission to improve handwashing habits around the world, helping over 1 billion people since 2010,” says Global Executive Vice President of Unilever’s Skin Cleansing category, Samir Singh.
“This simple habit can make a huge difference, and we want to play our part by helping people do everything within their power to keep themselves and their communities safe through Covid-19.”
Chris Barron, Vice President of Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care division in the UK & Ireland, adds: “The re-introduction of Lifebuoy to the UK & Ireland market has never been more important than it is now.
“Our role is not just to provide people with great products to use at home or on-the-go, but also to remind them about the importance of a good hand hygiene regime.”
text When Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan was created ten years ago, “no one knew about sustainable sourcing or sustainability,” says Andrea Granier, Sustainability Procurement Manager. Few considered its non-practice would cause resources to degrade or the ability for people to eat food off that land to disappear.
“Now most of our suppliers are running their own sustainability agendas independently from Unilever. That’s the best achievement we can have,” he adds.
Setting the bar for ourselves and our suppliers
From the start it was an ambitious programme. “The goal of creating our Sustainable Agricultural Code was to set a bar that needs to be cleared in order for a product to enter the Unilever supply chain,” says Giulia Stellari, Sustainability Sourcing Director.
“We had the guts to set targets we knew were going to be hard to meet,” adds Sustainability Sourcing Development Director Jan Kees Vis.
It has seen us launch dozens of initiatives with over 40 partners to promote sustainable sourcing, partnering with NGOs to help formulate targets around biodiversity and make hard choices to select suppliers that were committed to taking the journey with us.
And because sustainable sourcing can only be achieved where human rights are respected, we have been absolutely committed to embedding human rights in all we do right across the value chain.
Partnering with bodies such as the UN to drive social impact on issues such as safety for women and being transparent about the issues and challenges we face through the publishing of our human rights reports.
A progressive journey
Our work in responsible sourcing is rightly a work in progress. We continue to work with farmers, suppliers, governments and civil society to promote sustainable agriculture and forestry systems beyond the boundaries of our own business needs.
We continue to focus our efforts where we can have the highest impact. “Our 100% ambition still remains, and our predominant focus is on those materials where we have ‘line of sight to farm’, as we call it, and greatest buying power,” says Petronella Meekers, Unilever’s Global Head of Sustainable Sourcing. “This is where we feel we can most influence producers to adopt sustainable practices.”
More remains to be done. “We want greater assurances that the impacts we wish to see, such as no deforestation, regenerative practices and improved yields for smallholders, are being driven forward,” she says.
This film shares the story of our progress and sustainable sourcing initiatives so far, told by the people who have helped shape and drive the programme.

text A year ago, our Knorr brand and WWF-UK published the Future 50 Foods report and challenged the world to diversify its diet.
The reason was simple. Reports showed that our lack of dietary diversity was damaging our health and that of the planet.
Reliance on a small number of plant and animal species was making it increasingly difficult to get the minerals and vitamins we needed – leading to approximately two billion people suffering with micronutrient deficiencies worldwide (WHO).
Intensive monocrop farming was depleting the soil and necessitating the use of more pesticides and fertilisers, while continued dependence on meat protein was contributing to the rise in greenhouse gases.
Together with the resulting loss of plant and animal biodiversity, these factors effectively meant our global food system was causing more environmental damage than energy or transport (WWF).
By providing a list of nutritious plant-based foods that we could all be eating more of, the Future 50 Foods report offered a practical way of making sustainable change.
But what started as a thought-leadership piece, surprised everyone by becoming a key player in the climate change debate.
Future 50 Foods makes an impact
3,900 Mentions of #Future50Foods on social media, and 13,500 engagements.
667 Online articles were inspired by the report.
Force for good The Chefs’ Manifesto, the World Economic Forum and FOLU (The Food and Land Use Coalition) all acclaimed the report as a force for good in promoting bio and dietary diversity.
“We published a solution-based approach at a time when a lot of people were feeling hopeless,” reflects Dorothy Shaver, Global Sustainability Lead at Knorr. “That positive approach really resonated.”
According to Euromonitor, the global market for plant-based food and beverages grew at solid single-digit growth (CAGR) over the five years to 2019. And the upward trend is expected to accelerate. BIS Research, for example, is estimating growth of over 13% (CAGR) for the period 2019–2024.
As we celebrate the first anniversary of Future 50 Foods, we look back at a year of partnerships, programmes and progress.
1. We scaled up our food service partnerships
Uniting Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) and Sodexo, one of the world’s largest food services and facilities management companies, on this project offered a unique opportunity to drive positive change through Sodexo menus.
“We want to make an impact on the food people eat in restaurants,” says Kees van Erp, Unilever Global Lead Chef. “Together, Unilever Food Solutions and Sodexo can make that impact.”
Last September, recipes featuring Future 50 Foods – such as amaranth seeds, ube (a purple yam) and maitake mushrooms – were served by Sodexo chefs in 5,000 professional kitchens in Belgium, the US, France and the UK.
The experience has been so successful that Sodexo has decided to extend it to ten more countries in 2020.
2. We got creative with plant potential
An early success story in this move toward plant-based products has been the ingredient swap made on-pack by Knorr in Germany for key local dishes such as spaghetti bolognese, meatballs and chicken curry.
The carbon footprint of lentils is 83% lower than beef and 64% lower than chicken. By using this Future 50 Food – instead of beef in its bolognese sauce recipe or instead of chicken in the chicken curry recipe – Knorr offered consumers an easy way to give their favourite meals a sustainable ingredient makeover.
In environmental terms, this small change has huge potential impact. It is estimated that if the lentil bolognese recipe was prepared instead of the traditional meat-based version once a month for a year, it would avoid 25kg of CO2 production – the equivalent of an emission-free drive of 177km.
“Knorr Future 50 Foods also serves as a roadmap for our own products and recipes,” explains April Redmond, Global Brand VP. “We’re working to increase the number of Knorr products with Future 50 Foods by 25% and are aiming to have 50% of our product portfolio plant-based, both by 2025.”
Much of this innovation will come out of Hive, Unilever’s €85 million Global Foods Innovation Centre in the Wageningen Campus in the Netherlands, where 500 innovators are working to create products and food solutions fit for tomorrow’s world.
3. We teamed up with the world’s most influential chefs
In order to make real change, we knew we needed the support of the culinary community. So, we reached out to 350 of the world’s most influential chefs and tasked them with putting our Future 50 Foods front and centre of the international dining scene.
Within months, Future 50 Foods were being used in high-end restaurant menus, promoted on social media and starring in cookbooks.
For example, at the Paris restaurant of Michelin-starred chef Gregory Marchand, sustainable ingredients such as spelt, buckwheat and salsify take pride of place on the menu, with lentils even occasionally replacing traditional chestnuts in their famous Mont Blanc dessert.
“As chefs, we can help protect biodiversity by celebrating the great variety of beautiful plants in our recipes and on our menus,” says Tom Hunt, Eco-Chef, food waste activist, and author of Eating for Pleasure, People & Planet, available in mid-March.
4. We empowered parents in Indonesia
In Indonesia, Future 50 Foods have been embedded within the Royco Nutri Menu programme, which helps families learn how to provide balanced, affordable meals for their families.
This is vital in areas such as West Nusa Tenggara Province in Lombok, where 37% of children aged 5-12 suffer from imbalanced nutrition (Riskesdas 2018).
“Now we understand things that we did not know about,” says one mother. “For example, we just learnt that Moringa can be turned into soup.”
Moringa, a versatile Future 50 Food, rich in iron and antioxidants, is also very adaptable to the local weather conditions and climate, which is why Royco is encouraging people to not only eat more of it, but also to plant more too.
5. We trained teachers in Mexico
In Mexico, Knorr partnered with the National Union of Education Workers to launch a series of nutrition workshops for teachers in three different regions, focusing on Future 50 Foods.
Over 930 teachers were invited to learn about sustainable eating and provided with classroom support materials including worksheets, games and recipes.
It is hoped that through a ripple effect, approximately 47,000 students will now be taught the basics of healthy, sustainable eating, and that they, in turn, will share that knowledge with their friends and families.
6. We started to make our supply chain more Future 50 Food friendly
In South Africa, we’re working with WWF to help smallholder farmers in drought-stricken regions grow more viable and sustainable indigenous Future 50 Foods such as fonio and Bambara groundnuts.
These new, more diverse crops will not only be brought into Knorr’s supply chain, but will also boost smallholder incomes, create a more reliable local food source and significantly reduce the environmental footprint of local food production.
Increasing demand for currently underused crops in this way could have wide-reaching benefits. “Demand for a wider variety of crops could provide more farmers in developing countries with a boost in income. If handled carefully, with safeguards against potential environmental, social and economic risks, it could mean they can send their children to school instead of to work, can invest in the farm and become more financially secure – the whole local economy could benefit,” says Sabita Banerji, Oxfam GB.
7. We created an inspiring, planet-friendly cookbook
Our cookbook takes the mystery out of cooking with even the most unusual of the Future 50 Foods. It features a collection of plant-based recipes from around the world that will hopefully inspire home cooks to make positive changes in their daily meals.
Many like the Beany Shepherd’s Pie and Tofu Black Bean Tacos put a plant-friendly spin on family classics, while others like Black Salsify Curry or Mango Fonio Salad with Spiced Cashews take a more adventurous slant.
Created by chefs and verified by leading nutritionists, it is available as a download on the Knorr website, and to buy on Amazon UK and the WWF-UK websites. All profits go to WWF-UK.

text Unilever has joined forces with Indonesia’s Saruga packaging-free store in Bintaro to launch its biggest product refillery yet.
From the middle of March, consumers will be able to shop for 11 of Unilever’s brands, buying as much or as little of the product as they want, using their own containers.
The list of products on offer at the pilot refill station include Home Care brands Rinso, Molto, Sunlight and Super Pell; Beauty & Personal Care brands Lifebuoy, Clear, Dove, Sunsilk,TRESemmé and Love Beauty and Planet; and Indonesia’s home-grown sweet soy sauce, Bango.
Cutting plastic use through innovation and education
Indonesia is home to 267 million people scattered across more than 17,000 islands. It’s estimated that it produces 25,000 tons of plastic waste each day, with 20% of that ending up in rivers and coastal waters.
Increasing public awareness of the environmental impact of waste has seen the Indonesian government launch its ‘Gerakan Indonesia Bersih’ or ‘Clean Indonesia Movement’ to familiarise people with its waste management programme.
It has also created a plastic waste reduction map, setting a deadline of 2029 for manufacturers to reduce waste arising from their products and packaging by 30%.
Our refill station aims to provide an alternative for consumers who want to use our products while reducing the use of disposable packaging. Nurdiana Darus, Head of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Unilever Indonesia 
Creating new business models to reduce plastic use
Pilot schemes such as our in-store refillery which allows shoppers to use their own containers are just one of the business models we are looking at to help us reach our goal of halving our use of virgin plastic.
“Our refill station pilot aims to provide an alternative for consumers who want to use our products while reducing the use of disposable packaging,” says Unilever Indonesia’s Head of Corporate Affairs & Sustainability, Nurdiana Darus.
Refilleries are not only a chance to try to change consumer habits in how they buy goods; if done well, they can also cut greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and packaging production.
Widening consumer choice and a chance to play their part
Public awareness of these environmental benefits, combined with the option to buy the quantity of product they want, large or small, at affordable prices, has led to a growing number of packaging-free and bulk-buy stores throughout Indonesia.
Ujang Solihin Sidik from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, who works on policies associated with waste from goods and packaging says “we highly appreciate the collaboration carried out by Unilever and Saruga”.
“We hope piloting this new alternative business model that is more sustainable and environmentally friendly will be a good learning process for all stakeholders,” Nurdiana adds.
text Water is planet Earth’s most precious resource. We all need it to survive – and not just to quench our thirst. It powers industry. It provides sanitation. But climate change and extreme weather are making supplies scarce, unpredictable and polluted in many parts of the world.
Our brands are taking action to address this crisis wherever possible. We’re making water preservation a priority when it comes to product development, sourcing ingredients, and especially how the consumers who buy our brands use them at home – a factor that accounts for 99% of our water footprint.
To mark the UN’s World Water Day on 22 March, here are a few examples from farming tech and freshening fabrics, to faster-rinse hair care…
The launch that’s disrupting the laundry category
Our research shows that 40% of the clothes people wash aren’t actually dirty. This wastes time, energy, water, and causes irrevocable damage to clothes.
We thought it was time this changed, so we launched Day2 Dry Wash Spray in the UK in August 2018 and it is now available in Germany, Austria and South Africa.
A quick spray of Day2’s unique formula on previously worn clothes freshens, softens and releases creases, reviving them to a just-washed state instantly.
The packs are powered by air, with a recyclable solution hitting shelves this year. But best of all, each bottle has the potential to save 60 litres of water and prevent 400g of CO2 being released into the atmosphere by reducing those needless wash-loads. In fact, Day2 consumers have so far saved more than 25,000 bathtubs full of water by spraying more and washing their laundry less.
Taking quick-rinse conditioners global
Every Love Beauty and Planet product is formulated with careful thought given to sustainably sourced ingredients, recyclable packaging as far as possible, and social partnerships.
Since its launch in 2018, the brand has grown well and is now sold in 50 countries. That’s good news for water saving, as it means Love Beauty and Planet’s fast-rinse conditioners are becoming more accessible on a worldwide scale.
These clever conditioners use our innovative fast-rinse technology. They replenish and rehydrate hair, then break down faster when they come into contact with water. It means consumers can still look beautiful and enjoy quicker showers, while caring for the planet.
And those seconds saved all add up. If every woman in the United States reduced her shower time by 10 seconds, that could help save enough water to support the needs of more than half a billion people in a year.
The tech behind Knorr’s tastier tomatoes
Knorr is one of the world’s biggest buyers when it comes to tomatoes. Our sauces, soups and stocks use a lot of them, so we’re taking responsibility to ensure they’re grown sustainability – and of course that they’re as delicious as possible.
Through the Knorr Partnership Fund, we equipped tomato farmers in the Gastouni region of Greece with a small device that’s made a big impact on their water consumption.
By introducing tensiometers – little probes that measure the amount of water present in soil – they were able to use data instead of guesswork to plan irrigation. It helped cut their water use by 28% between 2010 and 2017.
Yields also increased from 76 to 83 tonnes per hectare. And with tomatoes able to ripen in the perfect conditions, their brix level – the official measure of tomato sweetness – went up too.
Hair care too good to rinse off
We launched ‘the good stuff’ last year in the US, when a small team from Unilever’s Beauty & Personal Care Division set out to create a disruptive new hair conditioning brand.
The idea came when the team commissioned research which revealed that 95% of conditioner ends up washed down the drain. They came up with a vegan-certified formula that is designed to do just the opposite.
Available in six formats to suit different hair types, the good stuff is made to stay put on hair. There’s no need to rinse it out. Instead, it’s made to nourish hair without weighing it down – and it’s in recycled, recyclable bottles too.
On average, the no-rinse formulas help users save 99 seconds per shower. It’s a move that could save 460 litres of water per bottle of no-rinse conditioner – equivalent to the typical amount of water a person would drink over seven months.
text How germs are spread
Germs are essentially the umbrella word for nasty things that could make us ill. Germs can be found in the air, our bodies, on food, plants, animals, surfaces and just about anything we come into contact with.
When we touch a surface such as a doorknob or handrail, we pick up germs up with our hands. And if we then touch our face, which we often do, we pass on these germs from our hands to our mouth, nose and eyes. These are the key entry points through which germs sneak into our bodies.
How soap tackles germs
Sayandip Mukherjee, a Virologist and Senior Research Scientist at Unilever R&D Bangalore, explains: “Some germs have an outer protective covering made up of two layers of fatty molecules. Soap can help to break apart this outer protective layer, trapping and removing these germs along with any other oils and debris that are present in our hands. Now, for soap to do all this, remember we must wash our hands for at least 20 seconds.”
Studies by WHO have shown that by just washing our hands properly with soap and water we can cut down stomach-related illnesses by 50% and respiratory illnesses – such as the common cold and flu – by a third.
Soap and water rather than just using water
Washing your hands with water is a good way of removing dirt and is better than not washing them at all. However, the surfactants in soap can help to trap and remove germs in addition to better removal of dirt than washing your hands with water alone.
Surfactants are the cleansing ingredients that create foam and break down oil, grease and soil so they can be removed from skin.
Bar soaps, shower gel, shampoo and washing-up liquid can be just as effective as liquid soaps in removing dirt and germs and keeping your hands clean.
Remember, any soap – bar or liquid – if used properly, will help keep your hands clean and safe. Sayandip Mukherjee, Virologist 
Your handwashing technique matters
The time you take and the technique you use to wash your hands are important. Follow hand hygiene practices frequently and as advised by your local government authorities.
If you use hand sanitiser, make sure it’s the right one
Washing with soap and water is a great choice for cleaning your hands and removing dirt and germs. However, if soap and water are not available, using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser is recommended by health authorities. But it’s important to use one that contains more than 60% alcohol. Not all hand sanitisers are the same.
What else you can do to help protect yourself against Covid-19
Scientists around the world are working on a vaccine that can prevent a coronavirus infection (such as Covid-19) in someone who has been exposed to it. But we’re not there yet. So, in the meantime, the most effective way of staying safe from the infection is to avoid being exposed to it entirely.
Based on the behaviour of respiratory viruses in general, the World Health Organization has outlined everyday actions that will help you steer clear of an infection, including:
Washing hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub (>60% alcohol content)
Covering nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing with a tissue or flexed elbow
Avoiding close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.

Angelika studied Human Nutrition at Wageningen University and obtained her PhD
in Medical Science at Radboud University, Nijmegen. She joined Unilever in 2004
and lives in Rotterdam with her husband and three sons.
Nobody knows exactly how our society will come out of the Covid-19 crisis. But as a nutritionist, I am particularly interested to see how living through a pandemic can help to establish long-lasting behaviour changes in the way that people choose, prepare, and enjoy products they eat and drink.
These are the three areas that I hope people will grow to appreciate as we move through and beyond this challenging time.
1. The provenance and preciousness of foods
Before the crisis, many people took for granted the advantages of our integrated world, like cheap travel and cheap products. But now it is harder to cross borders, which makes some produce unavailable.
As a global business Unilever is immediately impacted when importing ingredients becomes difficult. While we want to deliver on claims such as ‘made with Italian tomatoes’, we are faced with a reality where this may be difficult for a period of time.
Consumers could soon experience similar impacts in the supermarkets. After the shortage of flour, eggs, and toilet paper in Europe, real scarcity may occur for some fruits and vegetables. For example, due to the pandemic, it will be harder to hire the labour force needed to harvest perishable fruits like strawberries and cherries this year. The same goes for picking asparagus and other crops for which mechanical harvesting is not available.
Hopefully, this crisis can result in an enduring appreciation of where our food comes from, of seasonality and the labour that goes into harvesting it. I am hopeful this will result in wasting less food – a shift which would be hugely beneficial for the planet. According to the UN (PDF | 2.78 MB), if ‘food waste’ globally were a country, it would be the third biggest generator of greenhouse gas emissions, behind China and the USA.
2. The goodness of affordable shelf-stable products
People are stocking up on products with a long shelf life: packaged soups, seasonings, canned vegetables and pasteurised milk. But some are unsure if these shelf-stable products are as good as fresh produce. The reason for this doubt is that these packaged foods and drinks are often lumped together with foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fats under the denominator of ‘processed foods’.
But classifying all processed foods as unhealthy is too simple. Some processes, like drying and pasteurisation are used to make foods safe, affordable and available the whole year round.
The affordability element will become even more important as it is likely that Covid-19 will cause a global economic recession (according to the International Monetary Fund). This means that consumers all over the world will become more price sensitive. Nutrition experts like myself have a role to play in disseminating the message that some inexpensive shelf-stable products can be good elements of nutritious meals. For example, we have shown that the dried soups that many people have stocked in their pantry, have the same nutritional content as home-made soups.
I hope that people will continue to enjoy the goodness of shelf-stable products after Covid-19. Not only are some nutritious and consistent with a tight budget, they also play a role in preventing food waste. If it weren’t for processing techniques like drying, canning, and freezing, a lot more produce would never even reach the supermarket.
3. Cooking and eating together
Online recipe platforms have always been popular, but in these times, people are looking more for nutritious recipes with expert tips and tricks from chefs to turn meals into delicious experiences. They’re also seeking inspiration that brings the food court experience into their home, and guidance to involve kids in the cooking process.
We also see that people want to make the eating experience something special. This is important now as during the day our dining tables function as workstations and crafts or study space for kids. To make the transition, an atmosphere change can help tremendously.
I hope that being ‘forced’ to cook and eat together will bring about lifelong cooking skills. A potential side effect of adults and children getting their hands dirty in the kitchen, is that this will raise the consciousness of what goes into a meal. Ultimately this could result in better dietary choices. Above all, I hope that people will permanently value connecting with their loved ones over a good meal.
The Covid-19 health crisis is terrible. It’s bad for societies, for businesses, for individuals. The real tragedy would be if we come through this pandemic without changing anything for the better.
We all have a role to play in reinforcing changing our habits: people, governments, civil society and businesses. And we all have a stake in the outcome because habits that are good for the health of people are good for the health of the planet.

text Today, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), our Indian listed subsidiary and the country’s largest fast-moving consumer goods company, merged with GSK Consumer Healthcare Limited in India.
With this transaction, HUL completed the acquisition of the Health Food Drinks portfolio of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in India, while Unilever acquired rights to the Health Food Drinks brands in around 20 other, predominantly Asian, markets.
Unilever’s purchase of GSK’s shareholding in its listed entity in Bangladesh, GlaxoSmithKline Bangladesh Limited, is expected to complete later this quarter, subject to local procedures.
This is a deal that will transform our Foods & Refreshment business in India as it gives us a strong foothold in the wider Nutrition and Health Foods Drinks (HFD) category, further building our position in the rapidly expanding health and wellness sector.
The GSK portfolio includes the hugely popular Horlicks and Boost brands – Horlicks commands a volume market share of around 50% in India. The brands offer a range of beverage-based nutrition products that support critical supplementation needs across life stages, with a portfolio addressing child and toddler nutrition, women’s wellbeing and adult wellness. They are backed by strong research and clinically backed claims.
This portfolio has a strong track record of growth, but the category remains under-penetrated.
Helping India address multiple challenges
India and South Asia face a triple burden of nutrition: malnutrition, obesity and high levels of micronutrient deficiency among rich and poor alike. In fact, nine out of ten children have diets that are deficient in micronutrients and four in ten are malnourished.
The newly-acquired brands are deeply in sync with our beliefs on purpose, particularly our aim to ‘nourish a billion lives’ and help to unleash the country’s potential with better nutrition.
They are also aligned with both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Indian government’s ‘POSHAN abhiyaan’ flagship programme to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers.
As Sanjiv Mehta, HUL’s Chairman and Managing Director, says: “This historic merger reinforces our commitment to India’s long-term growth story and allows HUL access to a fast-growing nutrition category, further bolstering our Foods & Refreshment Division.
“It is also an opportunity and a privilege to combine our respective strengths and work towards broadening our social impact to help our country address the challenges of malnutrition, obesity and micronutrient deficiency.”
Hanneke Faber, Global President Foods & Refreshment says: “We are delighted to be acquiring a portfolio with such leading market positions. It further strengthens our position in health and wellness in fast-growing markets offering beverages designed to support the nutritional needs of toddlers and children, supporting their growth and development; as well as products that support other nutritional needs such as adult wellness, protein and energy; and women’s bone health. Horlicks and Boost are a great addition to our purpose-driven brands that aim to help consumers to get more out of their lives.”
New markets, products and people
Following the merger, HUL will be partnering with GSK (via a consignment selling arrangement) to distribute brands of the GSK Consumer Healthcare family in India. This partnership, with world-class brands from GSK (like Eno, Crocin and Sensodyne) coupled with HUL’s distribution strength, will help build Hindustan Unilever’s go-to-market capabilities further.
As a consequence of the merger, HUL welcomes over 3,500 GSK employees into the Unilever family, and we will look to harness the capabilities and expertise developed in this business to ‘boost’ our overall growth.
text The 2015 Paris Agreement was a defining moment in the fight against climate change. Together, the world agreed we must keep the global temperature rise well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Since then, it has become clear that limiting warming to 1.5°C is the only way to avoid a climate catastrophe.
COP26, the next global climate conference, to be held in Glasgow later this month, will be another key moment. It is an opportunity to turn the Paris Agreement into action: for governments, business, and civil society to come together and to put in more of the groundwork that will make climate action happen quickly.
For the sake of people and planet, this is an opportunity everyone must seize. And as a principal partner of COP26, our hope is that we can use our voice and influence to help accelerate climate action globally.
Businesses and governments must do much more, now
Businesses everywhere should be setting net zero goals now, with action plans and milestones, reporting on their progress, and engaging with suppliers, investors, and governments.
By helping to drive a faster transition to low-carbon, resilient economies, businesses can empower policymakers to be more ambitious. In turn, by creating the right combination of incentives, policies and frameworks, governments will help to propel business action to get the world on track to 1.5°C.
We want to see regulation to phase out coal and other fossil fuels, a price on carbon that reflects its true cost to society and nature, and a switch to renewable energy and electric vehicles. This should be coupled with an immediate roll- out of nature-based solutions and policies, which have a huge role to play in limiting warming to 1.5°C.
So ahead of COP26, every government needs to set a stretching climate target, which will help halve global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 at the latest. And share a pathway for how they will reach it.
We also need governments to protect people and livelihoods by providing support for developing countries, and climate finance to help people adapt and build resilience to climate change impacts. These impacts are already being felt everywhere and many of them are likely to continue or get worse, even in a 1.5°C future.
Doing all that we can within our own organisation
Protecting the planet is the right thing to do. It also makes good financial sense for business.
We know our consumers expect to see climate leadership and from the materials we source to the product information we share, we’ll do our best to help them to make sustainable choices. Which is why we’re making sure that as an organisation we’re doing as much as we can to tackle climate change within our own backyard.
We published our Climate Transition Action Plan (PDF | 11MB) to be transparent about our approach and to encourage other companies to follow.
Led by climate science, our ambitious climate goals include having emissions-free operations by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions in our value chain by 2039. We’re switching to 100% renewable energy and electric vehicles, and working with our suppliers and innovation partners to scale up solutions that protect people and planet.
We also know that biodiversity loss and climate change are deeply interconnected. Actions that allow nature to flourish will also benefit climate, and vice versa, and so must be tackled at the same time. So we’re ending deforestation in our supply chain, preserving water, and regenerating agriculture.
Everything is connected
While we work to lower our own emissions and engage our suppliers to take action too, the lion’s share of our value chain emissions falls outside our direct control.
We’re inextricably linked to the wider world around us – from the way our employees commute to work, to the energy consumed while using our products and the recycling facilities available to our end consumers.
We know we can’t do it alone. So in two weeks’ time, our brands and our people will be at COP26 in Glasgow, fighting for bolder and faster action. Because the planet’s future, and our own futures, depend on it. Are you joining the fight?

Chief Executive Officer
Alan was appointed Chief Executive Officer in January 2019. As CEO of Unilever, Alan is responsible for leading one of the world’s largest and most geographically diverse consumer goods businesses, with presence in 190 countries, serving 3.4 billion people every day.
This year marks the ten-year anniversary of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). It comes at a difficult and unusual time, with millions around the world reeling from the devastating human and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.
We have learnt much in recent months. Not least, we have a new appreciation for who really are the heroes in society. The frontline health care workers, of course. And others too, from factory workers and truck drivers to supermarket staff and delivery people. Their selflessness and dedication are truly awe-inspiring.
Building a better future: our ongoing purpose
At the same time, the pandemic has brought many of the world’s ongoing challenges into sharp focus. I’m talking about today’s big issues, like the climate emergency, rampant social inequality and the terrifying spectre of ecosystem collapse. If we are to address these challenges and build a better future, then a new model of capitalism will be needed.
It was this same determination to create a more sustainable way of doing business in which people and the planet mattered that led us to launch the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) ten years ago. The plan set out three big goals to transform our social, environmental and economic performance across the value chain.
Underpinned by multiple commitments and time-bound targets, the USLP represented a first-of-its-kind plan, in terms of its breadth, size, scope and ambition. At the time, we had no clue how we might achieve all these goals, although we knew it would take immense ingenuity, dedication and collaboration.
Looking back, it has been quite some journey. Some goals we have met, while others we have missed – and we have certainly become a better business for trying. So, while I am immensely proud of all the great things we’ve achieved, I am equally conscious of all that we still have to do.
USLP journey: a ten-year learning curve
Many highlights exist from the last ten years. If I had to make a selection, then one would definitely be the growth of our purpose-led brands – like Dove, Lipton, Hellmann’s, Omo, Seventh Generation and Pukka tea. These ‘sustainable living brands’, as we call them, have continuously and consistently outperformed the average growth rate of Unilever.
Other success stories include the cost savings we have achieved – over €1 billion since 2008 – by improving water and energy efficiency in our factories, and by using less material and producing less waste. Another remarkable statistic is the almost 90% of employees who feel proud to work for Unilever – a reflection, I believe, of our commitment to sustainability and building a better world.

Our USLP journey has also presented us with many hurdles. We have many programmes to improve livelihoods and to enhance opportunities for women, for instance, but measuring their actual impact has proved extremely difficult. Likewise, the complexity of many of the global supply chains that we source from has made our sustainable sourcing targets extra challenging.
We always knew it wouldn’t be a smooth ride. With that in mind, we have consistently sought to view hurdles less as setbacks and more as opportunities for learning new lessons. One critical lesson from the last decade has been the importance of remaining flexible. In a world in which change is inevitable, being nimble and open to new approaches is key to staying ahead of the curve.
Perhaps the most important lesson of the last decade relates to systems change. As a company, we can do much to mitigate the impacts of our direct operations. Yet the bulk of our footprint – be it social or environmental – occurs outside our four walls. To reach our sustainability goals, therefore, we need to work with others to change how key systems such as water and energy are structured.
After a decade, the USLP is drawing to a close. But let me be clear: this is not the end. Our journey towards making sustainable living commonplace for the world’s 8 billion people continues.
This is definitely not the end. Our journey towards making sustainable living commonplace for the world’s 8 billion people very much still continues.

Unilever Compass: our new, fully integrated corporate strategy
Now more than ever is the time for action. The pressures on the planet are getting worse and social inequality has reached a critical point – a reality made even more severe by the pandemic we are currently experiencing.
So, as we consider our next steps, what priorities should we focus on? We put this question to 40,000 employees and hundreds of external stakeholders. This listening exercise set us three key challenges: to drive purpose and encourage behaviour change through more of our brands; to embed sustainability further into every part of our business; and to do more to actively bring others along with us.
I am convinced that these three action areas will deliver the highest possible value not just to us as a business, but to all our stakeholders. This is why we are making them central to the Unilever Compass – our new, fully integrated corporate strategy.
The Compass very much builds on the past ten years of the USLP: the successes, the failures and the lessons learnt. It lays the pathway for us to realise our vision of being the leader in sustainable business globally – as well as to finally putting to bed the debate of whether sustainability is good for business.
Giving focus to the Compass will be 15 multi-year priorities that cover the full spectrum of our business and wider ecosystem. We are still finalising all these priorities and their associated targets, but I can confirm that they will be more holistic, inclusive and far-reaching than ever before.
Similarly, we will put in place a new set of industry-leading, company-wide sustainability commitments for all our brands. These commitments will tackle the key challenges of our time, such as packaging and waste, gender equality, human rights and fair value – plus, of course, climate change and social inclusion.
Repairing capitalism: a model for our collective future
As we look forward to the future, none of us really know what the world will look like after Covid-19. But I am convinced that there will be no future unless we double down on our commitments to look after people and the planet.
Globalisation and capitalism are good for a business like ours, but globalisation and capitalism at the expense of people and the planet are not.
It’s therefore up to businesses like us – working with NGOs, government organisations, academics, suppliers, customers and other partners – to drive a new model of capitalism, and build a better future.

text The World Health Organization names childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health issues of the 21st century. And it’s a key reason why Unilever is committing to new principles on marketing and advertising foods and beverages to children.
It’s a move designed to help parents, caregivers and kids make informed choices about the food and drinks they buy, and to address the rise of social media, and the vast increase in products on sale.
So what will we be doing differently?
By the end of 2020, we will stop marketing and advertising foods and beverages to children under the age of 12 in traditional media, and below 13 via social media channels.
We’re implementing strict controls concerning the placement and content of our ads, and we won’t use any influencers, celebrities or social media stars who primarily appeal to children under the age of 12.
We’ll also be limiting our use of cartoon characters. While you’ll still see some on our point-of-sale materials, they will only be used for products with a specific nutritional profile.
Introducing the ‘Responsibly Made for Kids’ promise
Our ice cream business will be leading the implementation of this approach and putting these new principles into practice. Wall’s – the name behind brands such as Max, Paddle Pop, Twister and many more – is becoming the first global ice cream brand with a ‘Responsibly Made for Kids’ promise.
This promise is based on three pillars, designed to help parents and caregivers when choosing products for their children: Responsibly Communicated, Responsibly Sold and Responsibly Developed.
Wall’s kids’ ice creams will be Responsibly Communicated. That means we’re shifting our advertising to speak to parents and caregivers – the people we feel should be the decision-makers when it comes to their children having a treat. And in line with our company-wide pledge, Wall’s will not direct any marketing communications to kids under the age of 12, or under the age of 13 on social media.
Wall’s kids’ ice creams will be Responsibly Sold. Since we know that children under 12 will inevitably be exposed to our products, we are introducing a ‘Responsibly Made for Kids’ logo on our point-of sale communications, such as product packs and price cards. It indicates to parents and caregivers which products are designed for children, so they can make an informed choice when buying our products.
The ice creams in Wall’s global kids’ portfolio are Responsibly Developed. By the end of 2020, every ice cream in the kids’ range will have no more than 110 calories and a maximum of 12g of sugar per portion and we are continuously working to further improve this.
“We at Wall’s believe that everyone deserves a little joyous treat from time to time and we strive to offer something for everyone. Our promise is a genuine commitment to make and market products to children responsibly. It is the promise of better ice cream and healthier, happier children. Both now and in the future,” says Matt Close, Executive Vice President, Global Ice Cream Category.
The deadline for compliance with these new principles is the end of this year.
text As a consumer goods company, consumers are at the heart of everything that we do. And we’ve been in this game long enough to know that they rarely stand still. Their choices and their habits are constantly adapting and evolving – and our success as a business has always depended on adapting and evolving with them.
In people’s hands
While some of our environmental impacts relate to our own direct operations and those of our suppliers, a substantial impact occurs when our products leave the shelves and go home with our consumers – what we call the ‘use phase’.
This is particularly evident in our targets on greenhouse gases (GHG) and water. Take our laundry detergents. Wash your clothes at 30oC rather than 60oC – as consumers can with our concentrated liquid brands like Persil, Surf and Seventh Generation – and the GHG emissions drop by as much as 50% per load. The same is true for shampoo and shower gels: colder and shorter showers lead to fewer emissions and, of course, less water.
Over recent years, demand for sustainable products and services has grown, albeit at an uneven pace across different markets. At Unilever, we have responded by launching a range of eco-efficient products. A recent new addition, for instance, is ‘The Good Stuff’, a stay-in hair conditioner that helps users save 460 litres of water per bottle. Love Beauty and Planet, meanwhile, now offers a fast-rinse conditioner that cuts vital seconds off shower times.
In a few cases, we have seen product innovations like these really take off and become mainstream. When combined shampoos and conditioners first came on the market, for example, people were a little sceptical. Yet, today, the idea of a product that both cleans and conditions your hair (thus saving water and energy for heating) is very normal.
Even so, despite positive uptake in some categories, we underestimated how challenging it would be to help the majority of consumers change their behaviours to embrace more sustainable ways of living. Even where we have seen some success, we misjudged how long this transition would take.
Unilever Chief Sustainability Officer Rebecca Marmot explains the challenge: “The truth is that these innovations and others like them have not been enough to make significant progress on reducing the water and GHG impact of our products at the consumer use end.”
The truth is that these innovations and others like them have not been enough to make significant progress on reducing the water and GHG impact of our products at the consumer use end Rebecca Marmot, Chief Sustainability Officer 
Connecting with consumers
So why has progress been slower than we anticipated? Looking back, one key factor we underestimated was the level of incentive that we needed to provide.
Some consumers are passionate about the environment and will go the extra mile or pay that little bit more for an eco-product. The number of people who fit this description is growing year on year, which is very encouraging.
What’s more, this group of eco-aware consumers has responded very positively to the sustainable solutions we have developed. TRESemmé and Dove, for example, have both seen strong sales for their no wash, dry shampoo ranges. The story is the same for the self-foaming hand and body washes launched by our Dove, Lux and Lifebuoy brands.
But there’s a lot more potential here and we continue to innovate.
Away from the ‘eco’ end of the market, though, most consumers are – understandably – motivated by more immediate factors like price, convenience, and quality. And one of the barriers is the widespread assumption that doing the right thing by the environment means paying out more or settling for a sub-standard product.
At Unilever, we have always worked hard to make sure this isn’t the case. Indeed, when products such as laundry detergents are reformulated to require less energy and water in use, they often work out cheaper for the consumer overall. When it comes to price, however, we realise most consumers still primarily consider what a product costs at the till rather than its cost over the lifetime of the pack.
Making connections like these with consumers has proved hard, says Henry King, Director Sustainability Science and Technology at Unilever. “We’re up against very engrained behaviours here. People don’t go into the shower thinking ‘this is a climate changing event’. They just want to get clean.”
If consumers see the issues at stake for themselves, then the story quickly changes. In cities where water shortages now represent a very real problem, consumers are more open to thinking about alternatives. In much of the world, however, climate change and water scarcity just haven’t reached such alarming levels of visibility yet.
Building momentum
Trust is another major factor in behaviour change. With hindsight, we can see that the consistency of our communication could have been better.
If consumers feel like brands are giving a mixed message, such as the need (or not) to wash at high temperatures for maximum product performance, then a degree of confusion and hesitancy is “understandable”, Henry adds.
In general, however, new behaviours just take more time to gain traction than we initially assumed. Change first requires the buy-in of a small group of trendsetters, then a larger group of early adopters, and only later, when consumers finally begin to see those in their immediate circle behaving differently, are most people ready to take the leap. What behavioural theorists refer to as ‘herding’.
“Even when a brand has a large share in a market, generating this kind of momentum is very, very difficult. In competitive categories, like those our brands habitually operate in, the challenge is even greater,” says Henry.
Over the years, we’ve learnt many lessons about making environmental behaviours easier and more attractive to consumers – all of which help inform our brands’ ongoing efforts to ‘nudge’ people to use our products more sustainably. Our work continues.
Beyond individuals to changing whole systems
At the same time, we’re also pushing forward with a parallel approach. Instead of trying to change one consumer at a time, we’re asking ourselves if it is possible to change the overall system in which we all operate.
The core idea here is relatively straightforward. Take showering, says Thomas Lingard, Unilever’s Global Sustainability Director, Climate and Environment. Just imagine if every shower ran on renewable electricity rather than on power from fossil fuel. Suddenly we decouple climate change from the enjoyment of long hot showers.
As ever, what sounds simple on paper turns out to be more complex in practice. The ability to shift entire systems onto a sustainable footing falls far outside the influence of any single company. Instead, it requires coordinated action by multiple organisations from across all sectors.
More than anyone, government has to lead the way here. For that reason, we are working hard to advocate for progressive policies that will transform the type of electricity that consumers receive and the way their water resources are managed.
We are seeing progress, especially around the adoption of renewable energy. But the pace is still too slow. To speed up this systems-level change, we plan to increase our advocacy efforts and our cross-sector collaborations in the future.
Mass behaviour change remains key to achieving our sustainability goals. Ideally, we want to remove the hassle factor for consumers. And we think the most effective way of achieving this is not through asking them to change, but to change the systems around them.
Lessons for the future
Be clear and consistent in why behaviour change is important and what changes we are asking consumers to make.
Demonstrate that sustainable living can be good for consumers as well as good for the planet.
Increase our work through cross-sector collaborations and advocacy to transform the systems in which our products are used (eg water and energy)
text New research from Smile – our family of oral care brands which includes Signal, Pepsodent, Mentadent, P/S, Aim and Prodent – reveals that children who skip brushing their teeth at night are twice as likely to suffer from poor oral health and dental pain. These problems can make them miss school and undermine their confidence and social skills.
Brushing day and night with a fluoride toothpaste can cut the risk of tooth decay for children by 50% compared to brushing once a day. That’s because at night we produce less saliva which means that our mouth doesn’t get naturally cleaned as often. It creates a more hospitable environment for the germs and bacteria that build up throughout the day to multiply, fast.
Yet despite dentists warning that brushing before bed is vital to stave off tooth decay, Smile’s latest study discovered a startling number of children simply don’t do it.
The findings report that 43% of children in Ghana, 35% of children in Egypt, and around one in five children across France, Vietnam and Indonesia go to bed without brushing their teeth. Many parents even reward their children by allowing them to skip the bedtime brush.
Brush, Story, Sleep
Smile’s new campaign, launching on World Oral Health Day on 20 March, sets out to change this damaging pattern. But it’s not doing so by introducing a new toothbrush or a tasty toothpaste. Instead, it’s applying behavioural science to replace bad habits with a regular routine that builds in tooth-brushing – an important change that experts say can last a lifetime.
Working with behavioural scientist Professor Tim Newton at the world-renowned King’s College London,* Smile developed Brush, Story, Sleep. It’s a simple but fun programme designed to help care-givers and children create a night-time routine that combines a bedtime story with night-time brushing.
Key to this is Smile’s new bedtime story book – a collection of 21 stories entitled The Adventures of Little Brush Big Brush. It stars two adorable characters who travel the world and pick up tooth-brushing tips from an array of animal friends.
And it’s no accident that the book features 21 tales – a new one every night for three weeks. That’s precisely the length of time behavioural scientists say it takes to establish a routine and turn it into a habit that will hopefully stick for life.
As well as the book, Smile is also providing care-givers and kids with a 21-night tooth-brushing calendar so they can track their progress throughout the three weeks, and a Little Brush Big Brush bookmark, designed to remind children at just the right moment that they need to brush their teeth before they go to bed.
Putting purpose into practice
“At Smile, our purpose is to eradicate preventable oral disease so everyone can unlock the power of their smile,” says Mariano Sampietro, Global Brand Vice President for Smile.
“We believe nothing should get in the way of smiling – especially not poor oral health. That’s why we must continue to bring new expertise, like behaviour science, into our business, to help us spread outstanding oral health through our products and educational programmes around the world,” he adds.
Smile brands have been running Brush Day & Night school programmes, free dental checks and campaigns to promote good oral hygiene for over 25 years and have reached more than 102 million people worldwide.

text What’s it like to go to the office after months of working from home?
On 2 March, our colleagues in Shanghai headed back to their desks for the first time since the 24 January.
Although most will still spend some time working remotely, for many getting back to the office, even for just a few days a week, is a milestone on the road to recovering some sort of new normality.
A milestone that many colleagues have met with a mix of relief, apprehension and excitement.
“Returning to a physical workplace has required a mindset shift after such an extended period of remote working,” explains Janet Huan, Senior Supply Chain GTM Manager, GTM Excellence.
The road to a new normal
For Kay Zhu, Marketing Management Trainee, the first issue she had to face was the practicality of how she was going to get to the office.
“I live quite far away from my workplace, and at first I had no idea how to stay safe during my daily commute,” she explains.
“However, I then decided to take the company shuttle bus, and all my worries disappeared when I saw how clean they were.”
Disinfected twice a day, the shuttles operate a strict hygiene and social distancing regime that includes limiting seating to one person per row, requiring 24-hour advance booking and the mandatory wearing of masks.
Everything is aimed at keeping the risk of transmission as low as possible, and helping people feel safe.
Creating a safer workspace
The new social distancing rules also mean that many things that used to be taken for granted are now highly regulated.
Before even stepping inside their office building, for example, everyone has to be granted a daily e-pass, which they can only receive once they have logged their daily health status and checked their temperature.
Lunchtimes at the canteen have also changed. They are now staggered by floor, with only one person at a time allowed to eat at each table.
There are also guidelines on how many people can take the lift or be in a meeting room at the same time. Hand gel is available everywhere and face masks have become obligatory. Similar measures are taking place across other China sites, such as labs and factories.
“Everyone is more conscious of personal hygiene, which is essential in order to keep everybody safe,” says Janet.
“But I have to say that wearing a mask all day in the office is a bit of a challenge – especially as the weather gets warmer,” she adds.
Pivoting to next best options
Confronted with all these new rules, Kay found it difficult at first to imagine how any work could get done.
The answer lay in the well-established network of virtual platforms and tools already in place to support agile working throughout the company.
While sometimes nothing beats a quick face-to-face chat, hopping on a Teams video call has quickly become a good substitute.
“Discussions are now done in writing or virtually,” says Kay, explaining how the shift to virtual meetings has allowed her to quickly gain experience and confidence in using remote working tools.
“Thanks to Company WeChat and Microsoft Teams, we are still aiming to reach all our goals,” says Janet.
Continuity and opportunity in crisis
She is not alone in being grateful for the support of technology during this crisis.
From helping colleagues sell products innovatively via live streaming and WeChat groups, to supporting home care teams fast-track new product launches, an agile mindset plus the right technology has allowed work to continue throughout the crisis – and help the team find new opportunities.
Products such as the Hygiene Botanicals range, Omo’s new line of disinfectant products, and personal hygiene products from Lifebuoy, Lux and Dove have had their launches fast-tracked at unprecedented speed.
As Janet concludes, “Despite all the changes and inconveniences, we are in the process of getting back to a (new) normal.”
text Five months ago, most people hadn’t even heard of Covid-19. But virtually overnight, all attention turned to this invisible yet deadly disease. And rightly so. Lives were – are – at stake.
In doing so, the focus shifted from a far greater and ever-present threat to people and the planet: the climate and nature crisis.
These haven’t gone away while the world has been dealing with Covid-19. Far from it. They are deepening by the day.
So, we must all double-down on our efforts. Because, while time is not on our side, we do have a window in which to act.
That’s why, today, we are announcing a new set of actions and commitments designed to improve the health of the planet:
The climate crisis is not only an environmental emergency; it also has a terrible impact on lives and livelihoods. We, therefore, have a responsibility to help tackle the crisis: as a business, and through direct action by our brands Alan Jope, CEO Unilever

We’re being even bolder, so we can go even further
We are recognised for setting ourselves ambitious plans. Last month, we celebrated ten years of our Sustainable Living Plan. From this, we’ve learned a great deal about what works and what doesn’t.
And last year, we announced bold targets to keep plastic in the circular economy – where it is reused, recycled or composted – and stop it from ever finding its way into the environment.
Our new commitments are the next step. And they go further than we’ve ever gone before.
“While the world is dealing with the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grappling with serious issues of inequality,” says Unilever CEO Alan Jope, “we can’t let ourselves forget that the climate crisis is still a threat to all of us. Climate change, nature degradation, biodiversity decline, water scarcity – all these issues are interconnected, and we must address them all simultaneously.
“In doing so, we must recognise that the climate crisis is not only an environmental emergency; it also has a terrible impact on lives and livelihoods. We, therefore, have a responsibility to help tackle the crisis: as a business, and through direct action by our brands.”
Tackling the climate emergency 
We will maintain our existing science-based targets; meaning that, by 2030, there will be no carbon emissions from our own operations, and the GHG footprint of our products across their value chain will be halved.
Given the scale of the climate crisis, we are making an additional commitment: net zero emissions from all our products – from the sourcing of the materials, to the point of sale – by 2039. That’s 11 years ahead of the 2050 Paris Agreement deadline.
Reaching this aggressive decarbonisation target will also require a level of transparency across the value chain that does not exist today. In our journey towards net zero, our ambition is to communicate the carbon footprint of every product we sell.

Looking after our forests 
To effectively tackle the climate crisis, we must also protect high carbon ecosystems, like forests, peatlands and tropical rainforests, which are essential to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement.
We have been leading the industry on sustainable sourcing practices for over a decade, and we are proud that 89% of our forest-related commodities are certified as sustainably sourced to globally recognised standards.
However, we believe that to end deforestation, we must challenge ourselves to even higher standards. And we have committed to achieving a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023.
We will also work with the industry, NGOs and governments to protect other important areas of high conservation value and high carbon stock – those that extract carbon from the atmosphere and store it – which are under threat of conversion to arable land. Without protection, there is the potential for devastating impact on natural habitats.

Regenerating nature 
We’re also setting out to help regenerate nature and preserve the earth’s natural resources for future generations.
The many years of working with the highest sustainable agriculture standards have helped protect forests and biodiversity, stabilise soil depletion and preserve water quality. However, it is not enough to protect and preserve. We also need to drive regenerative agriculture practices that have emphasis on restoring soil health, water conservation and access, actively increasing local biodiversity, and regenerating forests and other carbon critical landscapes.
To do this, we will empower a new generation of farmers and smallholders who are committed to protecting and regenerating their farm environment.
Initiatives that we will drive include securing legal land rights, agronomic training programmes, access to finance and financial inclusion, and development of restorative practices. This integrated approach will improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.
We are also introducing a Regenerative Agriculture Code for all our suppliers. This will include details on farming practices that help rebuild critical resources: soil, water and biodiversity. As we did previously with our Sustainable Agriculture Code, we will make this Code available to any organisation that may find it useful – with the goal of driving change throughout the industry.

Protecting and preserving water 
As part of our ambition to protect and regenerate nature, we will step up efforts to preserve water. Already, 40% of the world's population is affected by water scarcity and more than 2.1 billion people consume unsafe drinking water. Water security will continue to deteriorate as the impact of climate change is felt on water quality and availability across the globe.
We will implement water stewardship programmes for the local communities in 100 locations in water-stressed areas by 2030. To do this, we will take the learnings from the Prabhat programme in India, which ensures that people in and around our sites continue to have access to water as the climate crisis bites.
The programme takes a community approach to water management, and aims to not only help farmers across cropping seasons, but also address the basic human need of easy access to safe, clean water.
We will also join the 2030 Water Resources Group, hosted by the World Bank, to contribute to transformative change and building resilience in water management in key water-stressed markets such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia.
To further protect water resources, we also aim to make our product formulations biodegradable by 2030, to minimise their impact on water and the aquatic ecosystems. Although some of the ingredients that we currently use have no viable biodegradable alternatives, we will work with partners to drive innovation and find solutions to help us reach our ambition.

Accelerating action through a new Climate & Nature Fund
To accelerate action, our brands will collectively invest €1 billion in a new dedicated Climate & Nature Fund, which they will use over the next ten years on initiatives that protect and improve the health of the planet. These could include projects that restore landscapes, reduce carbon emissions, or reforest and reinstate wildlife habitats.
This will build on all the great work we’re already doing. For example, Ben & Jerry’s reducing greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farms, Seventh Generation advocating for clean energy for all and Knorr supporting farmers to grow food more sustainably.
“Our collective responsibility in tackling the climate crisis is to drive an absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, not simply focus on offsetting – and we have the scale and determination to make it happen,” explains Marc Engel, Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer. “But this is not enough. If we want to have a healthy planet long into the future, we must also look after nature: forests, soil biodiversity and water ecosystems.
“In most parts of the world, the economic and social inclusion of farmers and smallholders in sustainable agricultural production is the single most important driver of change for halting deforestation, restoring forests and helping regenerate nature. In the end, they are the stewards of the land. We must, therefore, empower and work with a new generation of farmers and smallholders in order to make a step change in regenerating nature.”

Bringing the planet back to health
The global response to Covid-19 has given us a taste of what fundamental transformation can look like. We’ve seen how much dramatic change we can drive when we understand what’s at stake and when people connect with what they really value.
While we continue to fight the pandemic, we must intensify and accelerate our efforts to tackle the two biggest challenges we face today: the climate crisis and social inequality. And it requires everyone. Not just government, businesses and NGOs. But every global citizen.
If you care about human development and protecting the earth’s resources, you need to care about a serious response to climate change.
Through our new commitments, we want to do even more to help restore the health of the natural world. And if anyone thinks that isn’t a worthwhile ambition, we’d just ask them this…
What planet are you on?
text Ideas that can change the world for the better
At Unilever, we know that innovation will play a key role in creating a world in which sustainable living is commonplace. We believe the social and environmental challenges facing the world can be overcome - but only if people, including ourselves, are prepared to do things differently. We see a big opportunity to support, inspire, reward and collaborate with a new generation of the world’s most inspiring young change-makers from all over the world with brilliant new initiatives that can bring about the positive change we need.
That’s why we’re pleased to launch the next round of the Unilever Young Entrepreneurs Awards on 18 May 2017. These Awards are all about supporting and celebrating inspirational young people from all over the world with existing initiatives, products or services that are tackling some of the planet’s biggest sustainability challenges. Sign up to stay informed.
Calling the change-makers
Are you working hard on an innovative solution, or know someone that is?
We want to give you a boost to scale up and change the world. There’s over 100,000€ up for grabs, along with tailored one-to-one mentoring sessions for 12 months with experts including those from Unilever and the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. We’re looking for entries across four key areas this year:
Farm to table
How can we transform our food systems so that they create value and enhanced livelihoods for farmers and ensure security of supply for the long-term while safeguarding the environment? And what can change in the way we make or consume food and drink so that they improve people's health and nutrition?
Opportunities for women
Millions of women around the world face discrimination and curtailed opportunities. Could new initiatives provide access to skills and training, create opportunities for women to actively, safely and fairly participate in the economy, or help women escape from poverty?
Waste
Are there entrepreneurs out there with ingenious initiatives that help to tackle waste – to reduce, reuse or recycle waste throughout the pre-production, production and consumption lifecycle? Initiatives that can demonstrate a clear business (financial), consumer (benefit), social and environmental case?
Water
Water scarcity, water pollution and sanitation and hygiene issues all present big challenges to people's development. Could innovation find ways to conserve or reduce the amount of water people and businesses use, or make a breakthrough that would improve hygiene and access to sanitation?
The competition opens on Thursday 18 May 00:00 BST and closes on Friday 30 June 2017 23:59 BST. Better yet, if you enter by 09 June you’ll have the chance to win a special two-hour tailored mentoring session.

text As families around the world began to stay home and stay in, an online trend emerged. Alongside daily searches for the latest news on Covid-19, consumers began looking online for food inspiration. Top of the list were comfort food bakes, easy supper ideas and recipes that helped them create a family meal, even if there were items missing from their weekly shopping list.
These were partly driven by necessity. Kantar Worldpanel estimates 503 million more in-home meals will be eaten per week during lockdown – a rise of 38%. But they were also driven by a desire to bring occasion and joy to routine parts of our day.
“Our strategy in Foods & Refreshment is called ‘Taste Good, Feel Good, Force for Good’ and it has never been more relevant than today,” says Hanneke Faber, President Global Foods & Refreshment. They often signify moments of connection we once took for granted, a tea break catch-up with a co-worker, a meal out with friends or family, an ice cream in the park on a sunny day.
“People want to make the eating experience something special,” adds Unilever’s Global Nutrition Director, Dr Angelika De Bree. “During the day our dining tables function as workstations and crafts or study spaces for kids. So everyone is looking for ways to transition to ‘downtime’. Providing inspiration to create a nutritious meal with your child, including the occasional indulgent dessert, can help tremendously.”
Offering consumers meal solutions, providing opportunities to re-connect and celebrate, and supporting foodservice providers have seen our foods and refreshment brands and Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) reach out into online spaces in new and innovative ways. Here are ten of them
Knorr: Easy inspiring recipes to meet @home cooking needs
Knorr’s mission to help people eat in a way that’s better for them and the planet is more relevant to consumers than ever before.
As countries moved into lockdown, the brand worked to create Knorr@Home to help households address a broad spectrum of Covid-related in-home cooking needs.
Alongside healthy, nutritious recipes that support immunity, the Knorr team offered store-cupboard recipes to meet tighter budgets and easy tips for creating restaurant-like meals at home.
To add fun to mealtimes, the campaign also partnered with local chef networks, influencers and foodservice partners in Mexico, France, Nigeria, Italy, Spain and Portugal to offer foodie inspiration through live streamed cook-along tutorials featuring Knorr’s Future 50 Foods and other exciting recipes.
As well as meeting household needs, Knorr is giving back to society, donating more than $1 million (€905,000) of products to aid the vital work of the Feeding America charity in the US and 1.7 million portions of dry soups to the Ministry of Health in Turkey.
Knorr@home has inspired customers with healthy recipes to support immunity and carried out chef-led cook-alongs on social to show easy ways to re-create restaurant-like meals at home
Hellmann’s: Stay-In(spired) from lunchtime to leftovers
Until very recently 54% of lunches were eaten out of home, but now it’s another meal occasion to be catered for on the daily menus of families. Hellmann’s Stay-In(spired) campaign set about providing easy and enjoyable quick prep solutions as well as catering for other emerging mealtime needs.
Recipes using cupboard staples, leftovers, lunchtime ideas and fun things to cook with kids were identified as areas where Hellmann’s could add a dollop of inspiration. Fun recipes using Hellmann’s mayonnaise instead of eggs in cake or pancake mixes, leftovers turned into lunch and end-of-jar spoonfuls used as salad dressings and marinades were just some of the resourceful ideas on offer.
Getting delicious food to where it’s needed most has also seen Hellmann’s USA launch a food relief fund to provide $1 million (€912,000) to feed frontline workers and those in need. Through a partnership with Grubhub, the fund’s benefit is twofold: it is set to provide 30,000 meals to healthcare workers at three New York City hospitals and to support local restaurants who will provide the catering.
Ben & Jerry’s: Supporting small businesses, spreading joy
In the US, Ben & Jerry’s has committed $1.8 million (€1,600,000) to support small business franchises nationally and impacted Vermont communities locally, and to make ice cream donations to frontline workers.
Support for hard-hit food operators has also seen the brand reach out to support Germany’s #PayNowEatLater initiative encouraging consumers to purchase a voucher for their favourite restaurant, bar or coffee shop and redeem it once lockdown is over.
In the UK, the brand is launching a programme with Deliveroo to provide 500,000 free meals to workers in the NHS, while 80 hospitals in the Netherlands have also enjoyed donations of free ice cream.
Horlicks: Immunity support for India’s healthcare workers
Zinc deficiency in the Indian population varies from 40% to 60% in different age groups, with inadequate dietary zinc being the primary cause. Horlicks is a rich source of zinc and contains other nutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D which are the key nutrients known to support immunity.
Packs of Horlicks are currently being donated to healthcare workers across India. The first have already reached 39 hospitals and will soon arrive at all major Covid-19 hospitals in 12 cities.
Magnum: Celebrating artists, empowering women cocoa farmers
Magnum is currently hosting a virtual art exhibition on its Instagram channel and website entitled Pleasure Imagined, with works portraying joy-filled city streets post lockdown.
As well as highlighting a collective of emerging artists, such as French-Ivorian Aurélia Durand, the exhibition marks the start of a two-year programme with NGO partner 100WEEKS to help women cocoa farmers from West Africa’s Ivory Coast who, like many other communities, have been impacted by the global pandemic.
Magnum is donating €250,000 to provide direct financial support to the women cocoa farmers. Virtual visitors can make donations too and download an original digital artwork as a visual reminder of their contribution.
Magnum’s Pleasure Imagined exhibition celebrates emerging artists online and sees the brand entering a two-year partnership with 100WEEKS to support women cocoa farmers
PG Tips: Keeping the older generation connected in isolation
In the UK, people over 70 years of age are being actively encouraged to self-isolate to protect themselves from Covid-19. As part of their wider brand purpose championing togetherness, the brand recognised that this age group would very likely be one of the most vulnerable to loneliness. To help support them, PG Tips formed a partnership with the charity Re-engage to fund the recruitment of 2,000 new volunteers to become tele-friends to seniors and connect virtually for a cuppa and a chat.
Pukka: Refreshing the body, mind and soul
Powerful organic plants such as ginger, turmeric, elderberry, echinacea and medicinal mushrooms are a key part of Pukka Herbs’ immunity tea and supplements range.
As well as donating more than 150,000 cups of tea to the NHS so far, Pukka has also been bringing its herbal wellbeing support and advice to global audiences online.
In France, Pukka partnered with yoga teacher Jessie Chase who performed four live Ayurvedic yoga sessions on the brand’s Instagram feed. Live Q&A sessions saw Herbal Director Euan MacLennan answering questions on wellbeing and immunity-boosting ingredients, while on World Meditation Day Pukka’s Co-Founder Sebastian Pole will offer a live meditation on Instagram.
Wall’s/Langnese: Happy moments for everyday heroes
We know that ice cream can't save the world. But we know that it has this power to create little moments of happiness and to bring a smile to your face – even in difficult situations. This was the inspiration for the Langnese team’s #BetterTogether campaign which offered consumers in Germany the chance to nominate teams of frontline workers to receive free ice creams.
Every day for five weeks at least ten nominated teams received free ice creams. By the end of the month, Langnese had provided 307,000 small moments of happiness to hard-working teachers, healthcare teams, hospital staff and many more.
Lipton: Staying connected, sharing hope
Lipton’s purpose, awakening the world to quality connections and help fight hidden loneliness, felt more vital than ever in the wake of Covid-19.
Across the globe, over 16 million cups of Lipton tea were donated to support frontline healthcare workers, seniors and those in need.
In the Netherlands, Lipton partnered with Koetjes & Kalfjes, a non-profit student initiative that connects the elderly with students through phone chats every two to three days.
In the US, Lipton is supporting healthcare workers with a roaming tea cart offering free refreshment and in Turkey 10 million cups of tea were distributed in hospitals to support frontline healthcare workers.
Red Label: Campaigning to reduce Covid-19 stigma
Launching an ad campaign is part of a brand’s marketing armour but Brooke Bond Red Label’s new Taste of Togetherness campaign aims to address the stigma and hostility that many of India’s survivors of Covid-19 face as they return to their homes and communities. “We can be socially connected even while we are physically distant” is the message that Brooke Bond Red Label would like to convey through this new film,” explains Shiva Krishnamurthy, Hindustan Unilever’s Vice-President for Tea and Foods. “To stay alone, is not the same as being left alone,” he says.
text In the past few months, we’ve been told repeatedly that washing our hands with soap is one of the best ways to protect ourselves from Covid-19 and help prevent the spread of infection.
So imagine how it must feel to go through the pandemic without access to soap or clean water, and with no hope of physical distancing or safety in isolation.
It’s the reality faced by millions of refugees all over the world. Humanitarian relief agencies warn that displaced people are among the most marginalised and vulnerable members of society – and they’re at great risk of being left behind during this crisis.
That’s why – as a business and through our brands – Unilever has been taking steps to help refugees through the Covid-19 crisis and into the future. As we mark World Refugee Day on 20 June, here’s how we’ve been supporting some of the planet’s most vulnerable people…
Donating products to communities in need
In March, we announced a commitment to provide free hygiene products and food items to the value of €100 million to communities in need around the world as part of Unilever's Covid-19 response.
We have already dispatched significant donations to UN agencies including the UN children’s agency, UNICEF and UNHCR (the UN refugee agency). The donation to UNHCR is one of the largest in its history, with more than 30 million bars of soap plus hand sanitiser, surface spray, disinfectant and laundry detergent reaching more than 40 UNHCR operations around the world to help improve sanitation and hygiene and slow the rate of the virus’s spread in refugee and host community settings.
Since the pandemic took hold, supply chains have been disrupted, and agencies like UNHCR, UNICEF and other NGOs are working around the clock to protect refugees from the coronavirus.
We are also proud to have a long-established partnership with aid agency Direct Relief to provide vital health and hygiene supplies in humanitarian settings. Direct Relief has launched a huge response to Covid-19, dispatching vital hygiene and medical supplies to vulnerable communities in response to the outbreak.
Promoting access to hygiene
We have launched a Hygiene and Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC) in partnership with the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. A number of the projects which form this work are targeting refugees and other vulnerable groups such as internally displaced people.
As part of this, in Bangladesh, we’re working with UNHCR and the International Rescue Committee to fight Covid-19 in the world’s largest refugee camp. Cox’s Bazar hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar, and the crowded conditions make controlling the virus very challenging.
A number of partners in the coalition are using a behaviour change programme developed by our Lifebuoy soap brand in collaboration with Oxfam. ‘Mum’s Magic Hands’ is the only handwashing behaviour change programme designed specifically for use in emergency settings, and has been successfully deployed in Syrian settlements in Lebanon, reaching almost 30,000 refugees, in partnership with UNHCR. This is being rolled out more widely as part of our efforts to respond to coronavirus through the HBCC.
Building brighter futures
Unilever is a member of the TENT partnership – a group of businesses committed to supporting refugees with services and livelihood opportunities, and using our voice to advocate for refugees’ right to work.
In Malaysia, we are working with TENT and UNHCR to encourage the government to give refugees the right to work. Our ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s is also committed to helping people who are refugees to further their careers. Ben & Jerry’s launched the Ice Academy in 2017 in partnership with TERN – The Entrepreneurial Refugee Network, to help newcomers overcome the barriers faced when trying to start their own entrepreneurial journey and build a new life in safety.
Through the Ice Academy they can access training, mentoring and part-time employment to help grow their business ideas.
Activism and advocacy
Many of our brands are making efforts to support refugees who are being affected by the pandemic and lockdowns.
Ben & Jerry’s continues its activism across European markets, highlighting how Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting people seeking safety, including those in detention centres, people in camps waiting for relocation, people stuck at the borders of the EU and those for whom access to healthcare is not guaranteed due to their immigration status.
Ben & Jerry’s has been clear on the urgent action needed by world leaders in order to give everyone – no exceptions – the chance to live in safety and in dignity. Read the eight concrete steps the brand calls for here.
“Refugees are already among the world’s most vulnerable communities, and they are at enormous risk during the Covid-19 pandemic,” says Helena Dollimore, Senior Manager, Global Sustainability.
“We believe businesses can bring important expertise, infrastructure, resources and networks to help reduce the impact of emergencies, provide relief and rehabilitate affected communities – as well as raising awareness. Through partnerships, programmes and purpose, we hope we can make difference.”

text On Wednesday, Gartner released its annual ranking of global supply chains, which identifies leaders in the field and highlights their best practices.
In the 16th edition of the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25, we retained our spot in the exclusive ‘Masters’ category. This recognises companies that have attained top-five composite scores for at least seven out of the last ten years.
The ranking essentially looks at overall business and corporate responsibility metrics, how peers from other companies rank each other, and how Gartner analysts also view and rank these companies.
Gartner introduced the Masters category in 2015 to acknowledge sustained supply chain excellence. The category includes just four other businesses: Amazon, Apple, P&G and McDonald’s.
This year – according to the analysts who compile the list – our Masters status was secured by our agility in planning, use of digital technology in sourcing and purpose underpinning everything we do.
They also recognised our response to Covid-19, highlighting our repurposing of factories to make hand sanitisers, donating €100 million in products, making available €500 million of cash flow relief for small and medium-sized suppliers and customers, and protecting jobs.
In a message to all employees who work in the function, our Chief Supply Chain Officer Marc Engel wrote: “I hope you feel proud of this recognition which is testament to each one of you and your continued hard work and commitment in times of normality and in times of crisis. I am very grateful to be part of our world-class supply chain team.”
About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25
The Supply Chain Top 25 ranking comprises two main components: business performance and opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past. The opinion component offers an eye to future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score.
Mike Griswold, VP Analyst at the Gartner Supply Chain practice, says: “With substantial amounts of the economy closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders need an agile strategy that allows the supply chain organisation to sense and respond to changes in the business context as they happen. Our ranking highlights companies that possess these strategies and other differentiating capabilities.”

text One of the three big goals of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan was to improve health and wellbeing for more than 1 billion people, part of which was about continually working to improve the taste and nutritional quality of our products.
As Knorr is our largest food brand, it had a major role to play in achieving that goal.
While Knorr has worked closely with farmers for 183 years, for the last decade it has been striving to make a positive change right across the food system – from the way food is grown to the way it’s consumed.
Sustainable agriculture and farming
In 2010, Unilever began rolling out the Sustainable Agriculture Code and in 2011 we set up the Knorr Partnership Fund, which supports sustainable farming projects that improve soil health, water use and biodiversity.
As Giulia Stellari, Global Sustainable Sourcing Development Director, says: “The problems in farming are inherently local and they must be addressed in the context where they happen. That means you need to upskill your farmer and understand what it is that will make a difference.”
As from 2019, 95% of all herbs and vegetables used in Knorr products worldwide have been sustainably sourced.
Improving the nutritional value of our products
With a high percentage of the world’s population consuming too much salt, sugar and saturated fat, we needed to reformulate our products to enable people to eat better.
Improving the nutritional quality of our products is a challenge, but we’ve made great strides. In fact, we’re on track for 70% of our portfolio to meet the Highest Nutritional Standards – a benchmark based on World Health Organization recommendations – by the end of 2022.
We have made great strides and we have more to do.
Helping consumers make better choices
To feed the world’s growing population sustainably, there needs to be a shift in the types of food we eat.
So we set out, together with partners, to create programmes that enable and inspire people all over the world to eat foods that are better for them and for the land, while being affordable and tasting great.
For example, our Green Food Steps programme in Nigeria, Lutong Nanay in the Philippines and our Nutri Menu programme in Indonesia help millions of consumers eat in a way that’s better for them and better for the land. In the UK, the Cheat on Meat programme has delicious, easy-to-make plant-based recipes, and our ‘Eat more Vegetables’ campaign has encouraged people in the Netherlands to eat an additional 5,000 tonnes of vegetables. We’re scaling up these programmes to reach more consumers.
The Future 50 Foods: an industry-leading collaboration
We recognise that there’s still a lot to do and we won’t be able to do it alone. We’re going to need partnerships to make all changes we need to see.
A great example is how we teamed up with WWF-UK – along with leading scientists, nutritionists and agricultural experts – to compile the Future 50 Foods report. This features 50 plant-based ingredients selected based on their nutritional value and relative impact on the environment.
“We’ve come a long way in ten years,” says April Redmond, Global Brand VP, Knorr, “but what we’ve built is only the beginning. We want to reinvent food for humanity.
“We aim to help 2 billion people eat in a way that is better for them and better for the land by 2025. It’s hugely ambitious but we’ve got the scale, the expertise, the partners and the will to do it.”
text Sustainability is all about making preparations today for what will come tomorrow. None of us have a crystal ball, but we have to expect new trends and surprise events to come our way – and to respond quickly and decisively when they do.
There is much that we can do to reduce the impact of our operations and that of our suppliers, customers and other partners. But there are certain changes that require an overhaul of how our systems work – which ultimately is the job of policymakers.
Covid-19 has hit the food industry hard. Here are six ways Unilever Food Solutions teams are helping foodservice businesses meet emerging needs.
We speak to Home Care President Peter ter Kulve and hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley about a new home hygiene campaign, which is all about cleaning smarter.
Tracing the origin of every single category of raw material that we buy is a huge challenge. Experience has taught us that our influence for change is greatest where we have the clearest line of sight throughout the chain – so that’s where we are focusing.
As parts of the world start to loosen their lockdowns, a new Unilever–Uber partnership is helping people get back on the move safely
When we set our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan targets ten years ago, we knew we would have to work immensely hard on multiple fronts to meet them. And that’s what we have done. What we didn’t realise was how hard it would be to measure our progress.
We’re supporting global and national efforts to help protect lives and livelihoods during the Coronavirus pandemic. Here are just a few examples of how we’re contributing.
Ten years ago we set out on a journey to become the world’s most sustainable business. As we celebrate a decade of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, we're reflecting on what we've learnt and what comes next.
For more than a century, we’ve been a business driven by purpose. And ten years ago, with our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), we set out on a journey to become the world’s most sustainable business.
A decade ago, the soap brand set out to make handwashing with soap a habit for more than 1 billion people by 2020. Here’s how it reached that goal, and why it’s still committed to making an even bigger impact in the years to come.
How a day to raise awareness became a practical, replicable behavioural change programme reaching 28 million people with clean, safe toilets.

"We all play a key part in our green world."
We’ve come a long way since we launched our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) in 2010. Working in partnership with other businesses, governments and NGOs, we’ve strived to make a real difference in the world, but we know we have a long way to go yet. We don’t have all the answers.
One of the driving forces behind our USLP has been our employees who bring it to life every day. So, who better to help us continue to shape the plan and the future of our business? With this in mind, we launched the USLP: Through your eyes photography competition to give our people the opportunity to show us the issues that matter most to them.
Some 998 colleagues from 58 countries entered the competition, and a grand total of 9,414 photographs were submitted.
There were seven categories for employees to enter, all shaped around the themes and issues that matter most to the business and are in line with our commitment to help realise the UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).

text Unprecedented is the word we seem to be reaching for most when describing the Covid-19 crisis.
Certainly for a newly established business unit like Ice Cream Now (ICNOW), facing an international crisis of this magnitude has been, and continues to be, a huge challenge.
Tasked with providing home delivery solutions for Unilever's stable of ice cream brands, including Ben & Jerry’s, Magnum, GROM and Carte d’Or, ICNOW’s main focus is on establishing partnerships and collaborations with restaurants, food chains and delivery services around the world.
“The Covid-19 pandemic has meant we have had to learn fast and react with unprecedented speed,” says Rachelle Schuimer, Global Lead, Virtual Stores (DTC) at Unilever.
Here are five lessons the team has learnt… so far!
1. Learn from the experience of your global colleagues
“The power of being closely connected with the community across the world is incredible – there is so much we can learn from each other,” says Rachelle.
“As the first market to experience lockdown, our China team was able to provide us with important insight and advice very early on.”
Most notably, they were able to identify the different stages of responses to the virus within the country and how these affected consumer needs.
“In the first three weeks of lockdown, ICNOW in China noted a sharp drop in ice cream sales, which is understandable as people initially focused on home and food essentials only. Surprisingly, when people recovered from the shock of having to stay at home, they began to want to treat themselves with food delivery. And after just 2–3 weeks we would see orders picking up again, way beyond our initial baseline.”
Having this kind of concrete information to work with when everything seemed so unstable was invaluable to the teams.
“Being able to anticipate this initial drop and then the pick-up ensured that those of us at an earlier stage in the crisis were able to prepare ourselves so that we could better deliver what our consumers needed when they needed it – for example by ensuring more frequent restocking at our pick-up points (PUPs) and recruiting new PUPs to be available for more consumers.
2. Pivot to online work systems quickly
Sharing this type of actionable information was clearly vital, but with staff in lockdown, new ways of working had to be set up quickly to ensure action points could be communicated to, and implemented by, teams around the world.
For the ICNOW teams, platforms like WhatsApp and Microsoft Teams have become key in maintaining communication and momentum – allowing them to review resources and project workstreams while making sure everyone is on task and has the support they need.
The team stays closely connected with daily morning catch-ups over a digital cup of coffee on Teams and continuous conversations on WhatsApp with the full global ICNOW community. “Countries share examples of what they are doing and the results they are getting – which is super-inspiring and brings great positive energy. Keeping the right energy, embracing learning from each other and stealing with pride what we know works is crucial in order to be able to act with speed,” says Rachelle.
Ensuring that everyone could benefit from each other’s experiences was also the reason ICNOW set up ‘Share ’n’ Learn’ sessions on Microsoft Teams.
Focusing on sharing best practice and insights, these sessions have proved to be hugely influential, especially as regards crisis management and future planning.
Following a session on why the GroceryNow 30-minute delivery business model was becoming so relevant to consumers and with practical guidance on key actions for this space, for example, numerous markets were inspired to bring forward their proposed GroceryNow plans with delivery partners.
3. Ensure you are engaged in the right consumer conversations
Getting consumer communication right in such sensitive times has perhaps been the most important learning curve.
Whether adapting marketing messages to fit the new lockdown situation or getting involved with thanking frontline staff with ice cream treats, markets have had to be very much in tune with the needs of the consumer on the ground.
In Italy, the first country in Europe to impose a lockdown, for example, the team wanted to ensure people could still enjoy the small luxury of ice cream. So they partnered up with a ‘dark kitchen’ (a restaurant available only online for food delivery) and opened over 50 virtual stores in no time.
As the stores opened when the country had been in lockdown for two weeks, the orders poured in from the outset. These results exceeded any expectations and the team has continued this expansion into new cities and regions.
A similar response was enjoyed in the Netherlands when ICNOW took part in the Samen Uit, Samen Thuis (Out Together, Home Together) campaign encouraging people to support restaurants by ordering home delivery from them. Again the option of enjoying a sweet treat while supporting local business and adhering to safety guidelines offered a very popular win–win proposition.
4. Don’t forget to plan for a new kind of future
Although short-term goals have had to be the focus in this crisis situation, planning for what happens once normality returns is equally important.
“The future is becoming a reality at an accelerated pace. When this crisis passes, consumer habits will have changed and we need to start preparing for that new normality now,” says Rachelle.
With new players entering the food delivery space, existing players expanding the width and depth of what they are offering and impulse buying increasingly becoming synonymous with at-home delivery, these changes could potentially have a huge impact on the business long term.
“It is key we work together with our partners now, to shape that new normal,” says Rachelle. “Channels are shifting, and we have to shift with them to meet our consumers wants.”
Videos offer an opportunity not only to communicate what products are available, but also explain how they are delivered safely. Covid-19 hygiene precautions, for example, are emphasised in a recent video that ICNOW created with key partner Uber Eats. “This video is one of the many ways we bring to life the way our products now reach our consumers.”
5. Look after your home team
Of course, none of these lessons are worth much without a motivated staff, which is why looking after the mental and physical wellbeing of the teams has been so important. “People are our No.1 priority – their wellbeing is what we take care of first,” says Rachelle.
From daily morning check-ins and the sharing of funny memes to wellbeing and fitness advice, WhatsApp has again been crucial in keeping the ICNOW team feeling connected and grounded. This is not new for the team, who have always kept ‘fun’ as one of their nine key values. However, during the crisis this element has become even more important.
“Whether it is celebrating milestones, participating in learning sessions, or taking part in an ICNOW quiz, ICNOW is a true community. It is stronger than ever now!” concludes Rachelle.
text About the author
Head of Unilever’s Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre
Julia has led Unilever’s non-animal safety science work for more than 20 years,
applying novel science and technology to ensure the highest standards of product
safety across our brands.
At Unilever we’ve been developing and using non-animal approaches to assure the safety of our products for decades. The list of PETA-approved Unilever brands that are not tested on animals anywhere in the world continues to grow. Sunsilk haircare and Zendium toothpaste joined the roster in October, alongside a new pet care brand (Cafuné) in Brazil and our other PETA-approved brands such as Dove, Simple, Suave and Love Beauty and Planet.
We’re committed to using what we’ve learnt in this space – along with our reach and scale – to help lead efforts towards regulatory change in how chemicals and products are assessed for their safety and to bring about an end to animal testing. We partner with more than 50 leading research teams globally to develop and apply our industry-leading non-animal product safety assessment capability and we collaborate with peers, NGOs and governments to share our research.
One example is our work with the Chinese and UK governments on non-animal approaches for cosmetics safety, and we look forward to seeing regulatory shifts in China from January 2021. These will mean ‘ordinary’ cosmetics, including shampoo, face and skin cleansers, and body washes, no longer have to be tested on animals in Chinese government laboratories.
As a result of our work, we’re one of just five companies listed by PETA as ‘working for regulatory change’. In 2019, we received Humane Society International’s Corporate Consciousness Award recognising our efforts. And together with our scientific partners at the University of Cambridge, we’ve just received the Lush Science Prize for our work in this area.
We believe there is no need for animal testing to ensure that our products are safe. But recent announcements from the European Commission and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) could undo the continued progress that we – and many others – so want to see.
We caught up with Julia Fentem, Head of Unilever’s Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre (SEAC), to find out more about Unilever’s stance against animal testing, our commitment to working for a ban on animal testing for cosmetics globally, ECHA’s recent proposals and what they could mean.
Julia, please fill us in on the background to ECHA’s proposals
To comply with the EU Cosmetics Regulation bans on animal testing, which were fully implemented in March 2013, ingredients cannot be used in cosmetic products if they have been tested on animals anywhere in the world. This regulation is seen as the gold standard around the world – and a win for everyone who does not want their cosmetics to be tested on animals.
It has also paved the way for similar animal testing bans in more than 40 countries so far. In October 2018 Unilever was the first major international company to announce its support for a global ban on the animal testing of cosmetics.
But the new proposals from ECHA appear to contradict it. In August 2020, ECHA said that certain substances must be tested on animals even if they are solely for use in cosmetics. They say this is to assess any risks to workers in factories during product manufacture.
Which ingredients are we talking about?
The two chemicals for which ECHA mandated animal testing in August were sunscreens, the UV filters homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate. But there are hundreds of other ingredients used widely in many consumer products for which new animal testing is being requested.
You don’t believe such testing is necessary?
Absolutely not. Workers’ safety is non-negotiable. However, with the scientific tools we have available to us in the 21st century, we don’t believe that new tests on animals are needed to achieve this. The ingredients at the centre of ECHA’s testing decisions have a long history of safe use by consumers, and have been handled safely in factories for many years by ensuring effective exposure-based assessments and controls are in place.
Also, to comply with the EU’s laboratory animal protection legislation we should be maximising the use of non-animal assessment approaches to avoid unnecessary animal testing. We must therefore have the opportunity to apply our new scientific ‘next generation’ non-animal capabilities, mainly developed to comply with animal testing bans under the EU Cosmetics Regulation, also under the EU’s chemicals regulations. We use these non-animal approaches every day to make robust science-based decisions on the safety of Unilever’s products, ensuring we protect people and our planet.
These aren’t new ingredients?
No. These ingredients have been handled safely in factories – and used safely by consumers – for many years. ECHA’s assertion that there should now be more tests in animals, which will involve the use of many thousands of animals primarily for administrative reasons rather than to better protect the health and safety of workers, is a significant threat to the progress that our industry has made towards ending animal testing for cosmetics and other consumer products.
So why is ECHA doing this?
ECHA has recently reviewed old dossiers under the EU Chemicals Regulation, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). They concluded that in some cases animal tests should be conducted, whereas at Unilever we are confident we can assure the safety of these existing ingredients without new animal testing.
There are also proposals to amend various annexes to one of the REACH regulations which will significantly increase the number of animals needed for compliance purposes. The amendments proposed would further restrict the science-based application of non-animal approaches, and force additional animal testing for classification of substances which are manufactured or imported in relatively small volumes.
What’s Unilever’s position?
We categorically do not agree that animal testing is necessary to ensure safety and strongly encourage the use of new scientific knowledge and non-animal data. We believe that the lessons we have learnt from doing non-animal product safety assessments over many years can be applied to assessing the safety of ingredients to protect the workers in our factories.
The future of chemical safety assessment is animal-free and it’s time to embrace modern, human-relevant, non-animal scientific approaches for regulatory decision-making. Anything else is a step backwards – for animals, for consumers and for scientific and societal progress.

text We’re proud of every You in Unilever, not just during this Pride month but every day.
And while Pride month is associated with carnivals and sparkle, celebrating tolerance and acceptance, current events also remind us that that change comes from taking a stand.
The genesis of Pride month is no exception. The first march on 28 June 1970 was held to mark the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots – a series of demonstrations in New York – and to concentrate the efforts of the LGBTQI+ community on their human rights and help establish places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their sexual orientation without being arrested.
We pride ourselves on being a diverse and tolerant business, but there is still much to be done to make it a tolerant and inclusive world.
It’s also why – alongside our online celebrations to mark Pride – we’re taking action. We’re taking a stand. We’re signing our name. We’re working to make our LGBTQI+ colleagues and consumers as proud of us as we are of them. Here are six initiatives we’re supporting.
Signing the Declaration of Amsterdam
On 19 June, our CEO Alan Jope will sign the Declaration of Amsterdam – a global statement of support for LGBTQI+ rights. “The Declaration of Amsterdam has a strong symbolic value for us,” says Frank Galestien, who works in Unilever’s Foods & Refreshment team and is organising some of our Virtual Pride events in the Netherlands. “Signing the Declaration is something that makes us extremely proud. It links clearly to Unilever’s purpose to allow everyone to bring their whole self to the workplace. This is a very important signal on how much inclusivity is valued,” he adds.
Sense-checking our resources with Stonewall
Stonewall works with institutions and organisations to create inclusive and accepting cultures. They will work alongside Unilever to audit our policies and procedures. We will be able to access their resources and training and participate in their Global Workplace Equality indices to benchmark how we are progressing on LGBTQI+ inclusion in our workplace.
Promoting inclusion in our business and beyond
We’ve joined Open for Business, a coalition of leading global companies to show we mean business on taking action on LGBT+ inclusion globally.
Introducing proUd, a support network for Unilever’s LGBTQI+ community and allies
Launching a proUd network of employees
We’re introducing a new Global Employee Resource Group called proUd. Its mission statement is clear. “We will be a beacon of inclusion for the LGBTQI+ community and allies, amplifying their voice in society and at Unilever, to enable them to be their true, authentic selves,” says founding member and executive sponsor Alex Owens, who is a VP in Unilever’s Market Analytics team.
“We hope members will be open to helping us shape its objectives and events. Everyone is welcome to join, whether they identify as part of the LGBTQI+ community or are an ally. And if people want to seek a support network in confidence – we will respect that too.”
Bringing support and advocacy to Teams calls
We’ve created a selection of four Pride backgrounds to bring vibrancy and advocacy to our MS Teams calls. Colleagues can pick a background, upload a photo, unmute and let the conversations begin.
Alex Owens, founding member and corporate sponsor of proUd chose Unilever London HQ as his Pride background
Celebrating Pride globally and virtually on 26 June
We’ll be hosting Global Virtual Pride, with activities taking place in our business hubs around the globe. Guest speakers and webinars will provide insight and understanding, and virtual DJs and dance lessons will be on offer to help us celebrate the day.
Continuing to listen, learn and bring change
Events will also be held to promote understanding and support diversity and inclusion throughout the year. These include a 21-day Allyship Challenge sponsored by the US team to encourage allies to be visible and impact change, and a training session in the UK to support people who want to ally and have more open conversations.
All these initiatives are just the beginning. Unilever will not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination. Our diversity as people is what makes us stronger. Inclusion for all is what will make us better.
text This year, the global pandemic saw more than 1 billion students around the world kept out of school as facilities closed to keep children safe.
Teachers pivoted quickly and lessons went online. But the social, developmental and wellbeing benefits that children get in a physical classroom environment saw 105 of the world’s countries making the reopening of schools a government priority.
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities were a crucial part of getting children back to class safely. Around the world, school administrators took the opportunity to improve access to soap and handwashing, and to put in place procedures for sanitising surfaces and cleaning toilet facilities.
Access to a clean, safe school toilet is a right, not a privilege
The importance of access to clean, safe toilets in schools may be a new lesson for some, but not for Domestos. The brand has long championed hygienic, well-maintained school toilets as a right, not a privilege.
Over the past decade, the brand’s social mission has focused on its goal of helping more than 25 million people to access cleaner, safer toilets by 2020. As well as building infrastructure and improving access to make existing toilets cleaner and safer, it has created community-led hygiene programmes. These have included a programme which works with school facilities teams to help children get access to cleaner, safer toilets and train janitors to keep the toilets clean and well maintained. The programme included in-school and online resources to teach the next generation about the importance of hygiene and sanitation.
The result of these efforts meant that by 2019 Domestos’s social mission had exceeded its target and improved access to sanitation for 28 million people.
“Surpassing our original target and reaching 28 million people is a great achievement and one that has only been possible through our partnerships and collaborations around the world. But there is a great deal more to do,” says Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Rebecca Marmot. “Today, a staggering 698 million children around the world do not have access to basic sanitation at school.”
And that doesn’t just have implications for the health of school students, it can also create a barrier to attendance. In South Asia, the impact of inadequate sanitation on the education of adolescent girls means one in three misses school days each month due to lack of privacy and access to water to wash their hands after changing their sanitary towels.
For this World Toilet Day, Domestos asked five leading experts in water, sanitation and hygiene to share their learnings from working to improve sanitation in schools and the actions they’d like to see to achieve clean water and sanitation for all by 2030.
text So what makes our intelligent factories at Indaiatuba in Brazil and Guayas in Ecuador so smart?
Factories that can be controlled remotely have been around for some time, but what makes our towers different is that their remote control and automation have been combined with advanced analytics and machine learning.
The result? Engineers and technicians can now use data generated by the towers’ algorithm to make strategic decisions about production and improving processes, rather than having to spend their time constantly monitoring each process parameter.
When this move toward digitalised factories was initially launched as part of our supply chain transformation programme, it was driven primarily by a need to optimise performance, increase flexibility and reduce costs. However, when Covid hit at the beginning of 2020, the project was accelerated, as the smart towers’ remote monitoring facility offered the perfect way to look after the health of our workforce, while maintaining the quality of our products.
How do the smart towers work?
Laundry detergent powders such as Omo, Deja, Radiante, Surf and Comfort are produced by spraying a slurry of ingredients into a tower which is blasted with hot air to dry it into a powder. Until very recently, factory operators would be responsible for manually controlling the moisture content of the powder to ensure that it was neither under- nor over-dried – either of which could adversely affect the quality of the final product.
Now, this function has been digitalised. “We developed algorithms that can simulate different scenarios and predict outcomes based on artificial intelligence and machine learning,” explains Daniel Correira, Digital Manufacturing Manager at LATAM.
“Now technicians in the control room can focus on more strategic decisions regarding production and use data intelligence to improve the process, instead of having to be constantly monitoring each process parameter. The insights are all in one place, accessible through a Power BI dashboard and the Unilever Digital Factory app, which enables faster decision-making, based on real-time data to optimise the performance of the tower.”
Gonzalo Sanchez, Engineering Co-ordinator in the Guayas factory, has experienced these benefits first hand. “I have learnt new skills with these digital tools and I have been able to make better decisions faster that will help the business grow,” he says.
Since the digitalisation, the towers have delivered on both efficiency and sustainability. They have reduced their natural gas use by more than 10% and their carbon footprint by up to 10%. “We’re seeing a reduction of waste, therefore we are also delivering on sustainability,” says Daniel.
How Covid acted as a catalyst for completion
Although the project had been progressing in sprints for some time, the impact of the Covid crisis catalysed its speedy completion.
The structure of the factory control towers made social distancing almost impossible. However, if product quality was to be maintained, round-the-clock monitoring was also necessary.
The intelligent towers offered a solution to both problems by providing remote working options that would not compromise quality. Thanks to the extraordinary support of global and regional technology teams, new safety and cyber security protocols were put in place in record time, and the operating parameters were back in the hands of the experts within weeks.
Agility and teamwork
There is no doubt that the digitalisation of the towers is a remarkable example of collaborative work on a global scale. Developed by a multi-skilled team from the UK, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador, over 90% of the project was completed remotely.
Sarah Loftus, Digital Engineering Director at Unilever, agrees. “The key to implementing this project effectively was to draw on local and global expertise,” she says, adding that identifying a clear business purpose and keeping the end-users firmly at the centre of all the development process was equally vital.
However, perhaps the most exciting element of the digitalisation of the factories is in its potential for future applications. “We have achieved a solution that can be deployed across our laundry powder towers, as well as scaled across similar technology across the business,” says Sarah.
“We have run virtual trials and even commissioned a new formulation remotely with UK colleagues,” she adds. “And this is just the beginning.”
text Everyone, everywhere, should have access to good food that doesn’t cost the earth. But what makes food good or bad? Nutrition? Taste? The impact it has on our planet? Or how it was grown and by whom?
All of these elements are factors in the food choices we make every day. But we don’t often think about the impact these choices have on people around the world, or on the planet itself.
Why our global food system isn’t working
The complicated, interlinked processes that bring food from field to fork are clearly failing a lot of people. There is too much waste and destruction of our natural resources.
We live in a world where 2 billion people are overweight, while 1 billion go hungry. Where more than 20% of all greenhouse gases are produced by the food industry, and yet a third of that food is thrown away.
As one of the largest food manufacturers in the world, we have a responsibility to help shape a global food system that is fair for everyone. That is why we are launching our ‘Future Foods’ initiative – it’s our plan to help people transition towards healthier diets and reduce the environmental impact of the food chain. In it we are committing to:
An annual €1 billion sales target from plant-based meat and dairy alternatives within five to seven years
Halve food waste in our direct operations from factory to shelf by 2025
Double the number of products that deliver positive nutrition by 2025
Continue to lower calories, salt and sugar across all our products.
These new targets also support our global commitments to deliver a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023; halve our use of virgin plastic by 2025; and achieve net-zero emissions for all products by 2039.
Making plant-based foods the new normal
So why plant-based foods? Animal agriculture is known to be the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions after fossil fuels and a cause of deforestation, water and air pollution and biodiversity loss. Reducing our meat consumption is essential. New research has shown that changing to a plant-based diet could reduce our individual carbon footprint by as much as 35%.
So we know that a diverse, plant-based diet is better for our health and the health of the planet. But if we want people to make the switch, we need plant-based options to be more accessible, affordable and appetising. They need to be the easy, obvious choice.
With a new sales target of €1 billion for plant-based alternatives, our customers will see a wider range of vegan and vegetarian options from our brands.
It’s an approach that is not just good for the planet, it’s good for business too. Two years after acquiring The Vegetarian Butcher, we have expanded this leading plant-based meat brand into 30 countries. Hellmann’s vegan mayonnaise is now available in 33 countries and Ben & Jerry’s now has seven non-dairy alternatives. And Magnum’s first vegan ice cream was recognised with PETA’s best vegan ice cream award in 2019.
It’s not up to us to decide for people what they want to eat, but it is up to us to make healthier and plant-based options accessible to all Hanneke Faber, President of Unilever’s Foods & Refreshment Division. 
Halving food waste
In addition to changing the way we eat, rebalancing the world’s food system demands a reduction of food waste and loss. Currently, a third of the food produced globally is thrown away, and 40–45% of that waste comes from our own homes.
The economic and environmental consequences of this waste is huge, as Liz Goodwin, Senior Fellow and Director of the World Resources Institute, explains: “Food loss and waste has massive impacts in terms of cost to the global economy, the environment and society. We know that food loss and waste contributes about 8% of global greenhouse emissions as well as wasting the land and water used in production of food.”
As a signatory of the Champions 12.3 10x20x30 initiative, we had already committed to halving food waste by 2030. We’re now bringing forward that deadline to 2025.
“We need as many companies as possible to step up and prioritise the issue of food loss and waste and take action to reduce it,” adds Liz.
Rebalancing our food with more healthy options
The transition to healthier eating also requires us to reformulate our existing foods to comply with the highest nutritional standards.
Lowering the sugar, salt and calorie count in our products is central to this commitment. We’ve already introduced a 110 calorie cap on our children’s ice cream and lowered salt, sugar and calories in a growing number of products, including a 30% reduction of sugar in our Lipton Ice Tea.
Our Future Foods strategy aims to extend these reductions, so that 85% of our foods will help ensure consumers do not intake more than 5g of salt per day, by 2022. And 95% of our ice creams will not contain more than 22g of sugar, and 250 kcal per serving, by 2025.
Fighting food deficiencies with fortified options
We are also committed to producing more fortified foods. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2 billion people are still affected by micronutrient deficiency, but fortifying foods with small, safe doses of essential micronutrients such as vitamins A and D, iodine, iron and zinc is a simple way to counter this deficiency.
To this end, we plan to double the number of our products that can deliver positive nutritional value by 2025. This is defined as foods containing impactful amounts of vegetables, fruit, proteins or micronutrients such as zinc, iron, omega-3 and iodine.
Again, they will be following the well-established footprints of products such as Horlicks Classic, which is fortified with 21 micronutrients and has been a staple in South Asian households for generations.
Creating food that’s fit for the future
Of course, the success of these initiatives requires us to innovate so that we can hit these new health targets without compromising on taste.
Over 500 experts at our food innovation centre, The Hive, at the Wageningen campus in the Netherlands are working on creating a new generation of nourishing foods that are fit for the future. This is where biotech start-up Algenuity is working with our Foods and Refreshment R&D team to explore ways of bringing foods made with microalgae to market.
Collaboration like this is crucial if we are going to achieve our ambitious targets. That is why we are also reaching out to farmers, NGOs, universities and communities to work with us, so that we can create the sustainable change the world’s food system so desperately needs.
Be it Ben & Jerry’s ongoing Caring Dairy programme – paying a premium to farmers who use sustainable practices. Or Knorr teaming up with WWF UK to compile the Future 50 Foods report, highlighting what foods we should all be eating more of. The objective is the same: to help fix our food system so that it’s fair for everyone.
A force for good in food
“The average person’s daily diet will need to change drastically during the next three decades to make sure everyone is fed without depleting the planet. By transforming eating habits, improving food production and reducing food waste, we can begin to solve these problems,” says Jessica Fanzo, Bloomberg Distinguished Associate Professor of Global Food & Agricultural Policy and Ethics at Johns Hopkins University.
Jessica adds: “Unilever’s commitments are integral to helping people make changes to their diet, with products they know and love.”
Our Future Foods strategy not only marks our commitment to transform our foods business, it’s also our commitment to helping transform the world’s food system. Only then will everyone, everywhere, have access to healthy, affordable food that’s good for the planet.
text Over the last ten years, our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) has informed the decisions we take and the strategies we develop. It is no exaggeration to say it has been instrumental in making us the business we are today: more resilient, more agile and, most importantly, more sustainable.
Social goals: no business is an island
This isn’t just about us, however. At the heart of the USLP is a recognition that businesses do not operate in a vacuum. This is why the USLP includes a variety of highly ambitious social targets alongside its many environmental goals. One such commitment, for example, is to help more than 1 billion people to improve their health and hygiene. Another is to positively impact on the lives of 5.5 million people through inclusive business.
Our efforts to achieve these exacting social targets has led us to develop a host of community-focused programmes. Almost without exception, these are designed and rolled out with NGOs or other partner organisations. Some interventions have faced setbacks along the way, but the feedback has invariably been very positive.
Nyaruguru, one of the poorest districts of Rwanda, is the setting of one example. Back in 2017, alongside a new tea factory that we were building, we joined up with the Wood Foundation Africa and the UK’s Department for International Development to train around 6,000 smallholders in smart farming techniques as well as in health and safety.
Because tea fetches almost ten times the price of traditional crops, the intervention has helped reduce poverty in the area. Meanwhile, the sustainable techniques learned by the farmers – half of whom are women – also means their yields will be more resilient in the face of drought and climate change.
“Working for Unilever means I can support my family and afford medical insurance. Importantly, I work near my home, not far away in somewhere like Kigali," says Ester, one of the programme participants.
Measurement: harder than we anticipated
Welcome as anecdotal evidence like this is, we also require hard numbers so as to improve our effectiveness and to measure our progress. Finding robust and meaningful ways to measure our impact across all our various social programmes has proved harder than we initially anticipated. Indeed, even after ten years, we still don’t have all the answers.
The example of our ‘Opportunities for Women’ goal illustrates some of the problems we are regularly coming up against. Our target: to empower 5 million women. We define gender empowerment in a variety of ways – from promoting women’s safety to expanding their opportunities – and we have corresponding initiatives in place for each.
The first persistent problem is one of accounting. Female empowerment is a complex, multi-layered phenomenon. No single intervention can deliver everything that women need, which is why we often run a number of programmes simultaneously.
We remain confident that this is the most beneficial approach for those we are looking to impact. However, from a measurement perspective, it opens up a risk of double counting. As Anouk Heilen, Unilever’s Global Sustainability Director and gender expert, explains: “Many women may well benefit from two or more separate empowerment initiatives, but we choose not to count them twice”.
Picture a woman involved in our Shakti programme, an initiative designed to encourage rural residents to set up in business selling Unilever products door to door. In an effort to improve her language skills or advance her bookkeeping capabilities, for instance, this same woman could well be participating simultaneously in one of our remote training courses.
“In our overall impact numbers, this woman would appear in the beneficiaries of the first initiative but not the second, with the result that the second is left under-reported,” Anouk clarifies.
Digitally delivered programmes add an extra element of complexity as data protection rules prevent us from knowing for certain who is participating, which presents particular challenges in validating the reporting.
Defining impact: a multi-layered challenge
But a more profound problem revolves around the term ‘impact’. How do we define and identify it? And how do we best measure and describe it?
Unlike environmental targets, which typically have established metrics (think: cubic metres of water consumed or tonnes of waste to landfill), social indicators are less standardised and often less quantifiable.
Finding an impact indicator that works across all our initiatives has proved especially difficult. After considerable thought, we opted for the output metric of ‘total people reached’. This makes sense in light of our overall numerical targets.
By their very nature, however, catch-all indicators fail to capture the full picture. An attendee list will show us that one hundred young women attended a training session on self-confidence, for example, but it won’t reveal how these women used this information afterwards.
Sandra Fontano, Senior Global Sustainability Manager and a specialist on gender equality, gives the example of our work around combating female stereotypes in advertising. Through our #Unstereotype campaign, our brands have taken a high-profile stand on eliminating negative gender tropes from our advertising.
The response has been very positive, she notes. On the one hand, it has unleashed a wave of creativity among the advertising agencies that we work with. On the other, it has pushed some advertising authorities to clamp down on harmful stereotyping that previously went unquestioned.
“We know this work sparks considerable debate and that these discussions can be a catalyst for women and men to see themselves differently. But a powerful impact like this isn’t captured in the measurement models we habitually use,” she states.
Sustainability also throws up another dilemma: how can we be sure that our social impact endures over time and doesn’t peter out? As a general rule, we have always chosen to take a conservative approach. For example, we know that handwashing with soap can help save lives, yet we can’t know exactly how many of these lives might otherwise have been lost to illness. As such, we only report that we have helped people improve their handwashing habits.
Standardisation: new models emerging
We do not have all the answers. Indeed, we are not even sure if answers exist for some of these measurement dilemmas. That has not stopped us looking for solutions, however, and continually adapting our approach as our knowledge increases.
Back in 2018, for example, we kicked off a pilot (PDF - 7.59 MB) with the US impact investment group Acumen to test out a new measurement methodology in India, Kenya, Nigeria and Colombia. This Lean Data model differs from other approaches in that it prioritises the voices of the women whose lives we are trying to improve, while also bringing to light potential blind spots and hidden biases.
To enhance the quantitative data we already collect about our programmes, the methodology uses a survey-based approach to obtain qualitative insights. In particular, this helps us to better understand how and why a product, programme or service might impact women differently from men.
“Right now, however, we have to acknowledge that there’s no universally agreed way of measuring companies’ social impact. And the approaches that do exist are often very labour intensive and hard to implement,” says Sandra.
Impact measurement is a dynamic field, however, and new models are emerging all the time. We are watching these carefully and analysing alternative ways to better capture the full impact of our social initiatives.
As the data we have on our social programmes improves, so will our ability to enhance the areas where our impact is high and to modify those areas where they are less so. Having an impact is our primary goal, not measuring it. But to achieve the former, we need to get better at the latter.
Lessons for the future
Consider additional or alternative metrics to ‘people reached’.
Examine bespoke social indicators for specific interventions.
Encourage the standardisation of measurement tools, indicators and benchmarks.
text Unilever has joined forces with businesses from the aerospace, automotive and medical sectors in a consortium which has received formal orders from the government to make in excess of 10,000 ventilators for use in UK hospitals.
The purpose of the consortium is to support the production of additional medical ventilators needed to treat Covid-19 patients in the UK.
We’re lending our engineering expertise to the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium – a collective which includes Unilever partner McLaren F1, Airbus, Ford Motor Company, Rolls-Royce, GKN, Penlon and Siemens among many more. We’re also bringing in our partner Microsoft for IT support.
Last week the consortium agreed to combine resources to make urgently needed ventilators for intensive care units, so they can treat an influx of patients suffering from breathing difficulties during the coronavirus pandemic.
Unilever is supporting the consortium with the co-ordination of the complex multi-tiered supply network and providing visibility of overall supply chain health and key risks. We’re able to do so by applying our digital tech to analyse key data metrics.
“Bringing together some of the most innovative companies in the world”
Accelerated production of an agreed design, based on existing technology, is already underway.
As well as deploying some of our brilliant people to work on this important project, Unilever is also supplying hand sanitisers and cleaning products for the production sites involved.
Manufacturing executive Dick Elsy, who is leading the initiative, said: “This consortium brings together some of the most innovative companies in the world. Every day, their highly skilled staff collaborate to create solutions that help millions of people, and this project is no different.
“They are working together with incredible determination and energy to scale up production of much-needed ventilators and combat a virus that is affecting people in many countries. I am confident this consortium has the skills and tools to make a difference and save lives.”

text The world doesn’t stand still. In 2010, when we first launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), things looked very different.
Change: a watchful welcome
As a global business, we are accustomed to change. Indeed, we welcome it. Change is one of the great engines of commerce. With it come new ideas, new markets, new opportunities.
The USLP recognises this reality – and the imperative to be flexible in the face of it.
Ten years ago, we took a long hard look at the ‘mega-trends’ on the horizon – climate change, global inequality, resource depletion, among many – and realised that sitting still wasn’t an option. We had to act.
Our targets were based on our best assessment of existing information and trends at the time. Even so, some issues have accelerated faster than anyone could have imagined, while others have come to the fore in ways no one anticipated.
As Rebecca Marmot, Unilever’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says, “over the past ten years, the pace of change has continued to accelerate, and we need to be flexible to stay ahead of the curve”.
Plastic waste: up the agenda
The example of plastic waste illustrates this speed of change and the consequent requirement for business flexibility.
Back in 2010, we knew that it was critical to minimise our own waste and encourage consumers to do the same. However, we could see that recycling capacity was limited.
For these reasons, right at the outset of our USLP journey, we included a commitment to reduce the weight of our packaging by a third and to halve the waste associated with the disposal of our products.
Working in partnership with industry, governments and NGOs, we aimed to increase recycling and recovery rates on average by 5% by 2015 and by 15% by 2020 in our top 14 countries.
A decade ago, these felt like genuine stretch targets. Today, this appears less true. Not only has the use of plastic packaging expanded, but our understanding of the size and impact of plastic pollution has also altered dramatically.
Matt Demorais, Corporate Affairs Director and one of our plastic experts, points to a seminal report published in 2016 by the World Economic Forum, with input from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. In the ‘New Plastics Economy’ the systemic problems with plastic were laid out in full for the first time.
“The challenges of recycling infrastructure in emerging markets; the implications that different materials have on packaging recycling; the need for new-look business models to kickstart a reuse economy – all these issues were presented holistically in a way not really seen before,” he notes.
Not only had it become clear by this date that the issue of plastic waste was ever more pressing, but it was also evident that our initial goal was no longer good enough: it needed to be more specific about what we were aiming for.
So, back in 2017, we announced a bold new commitment to ensure all our plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. We followed this up last year with and even greater ambition in the form of two additional 2025 pledges: first, to halve our use of virgin plastic (including an absolute reduction of more than 100,000 tonnes); and secondly, to help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell.
We could have “kicked the can down the road”, says Matt. “But, as our knowledge base grew and we developed more holistic solutions, the only responsible choice was to adapt our direction of travel and level of ambition.”

Listen, learn, lead
Our experience of dealing with this fast-moving issue has taught us a number of valuable lessons. One of the most important is the value of listening to those outside our bubble. Our involvement in cross-sector organisations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation keeps us alert to emerging risks and issues.
A second lesson is the importance of flexibility. We adjusted our targets, although our new commitments on packaging still sat under a broader goal on waste that stayed the same. Our approach is not to give up on our goals but to revisit our targets and ensure that they continue to suit our ambition. In terms of delivery strategies, ours is a story of refining and refreshing where we need to.
Finally, our experience suggested that we shouldn’t be fearful to break with the status quo. If it’s the right call, others will follow your lead. We’ve seen this with our commitment to reduce virgin plastic – one of the first to do so in our sector at the time, but now fast becoming an industry norm.
At Unilever, we are improving our risk management and scenario planning all the time, but we must be ready to move fast when events surprise us or unforeseen trends unfold. Going forward, we need to be nimble at reviewing our goals and open to setting new targets. This will guarantee our ongoing flexibility – and ensure our place ahead of the curve.
Lessons for the future
Listen to those outside our circles to spot the early signs of rapid change.
Respond quickly and decisively in the face of fast-moving trends.
Ask ourselves the hard ‘what if’ questions more often and more rigorously.

text Ten years ago we launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), a set of goals for our global business designed to help make sustainable living commonplace around the world.
Understanding the role our brands play in driving change has provided us with lessons in how to partner, pivot and navigate bumps in the road to create lasting impacts for society and for our business.
This film is about Domestos’s journey: how it went from backing World Toilet Day to creating a practical, replicable behavioural change programme reaching 28 million people with clean, safe toilets.
Something different from just germ kill
Domestos has always been recognised for its strength as a disinfectant which kills germs. In 2009 the brand wanted to push out its messaging and began backing World Toilet Day to raise awareness of the power of clean, safe toilets to save lives. “Every two minutes a child dies of diarrhoeal diseases because they don’t have access to a clean and safe toilet,” says Domestos’s Global Assistant Brand Manager, Simran Gill.
Poor sanitation is not just about the toilets. Not all communities have toilets. The practice of open defecation has been around for nearly 5,000 years. In 2012 Domestos partnered with UNICEF to use their expertise to create a programme that would achieve behavioural change at scale.
By 2013 the UN had officially recognised World Toilet Day and in 2014 the USLP set Domestos the goal of providing 25 million people with access to a clean toilet. “We were scared,” admits Domestos’s Senior Global Brand Manager, Matteo Rizzi. “We didn’t know how to get to so many people.”
Getting into something that was bigger than us
With UNICEF, the team launched the Domestos Toilet Academy to help entrepreneurs build toilets in rural India. It was resource-intensive and complex. “We started getting into something that was bigger than us,” acknowledges Matteo. “Toilet building is not something Domestos is synonymous with, we are a toilet cleaning brand,” says Simran.
By 2016 the programme’s impact was way below what they had expected. “We needed to narrow our scope – we revisited what the brand actually does – ensuring that environments are clean and safe at all times. This is our job,” Matteo says.
Understanding what role a brand has to play
One in three schools around the world do not have a toilet. Creating a programme for schools became the brand’s new focus. Domestos’s role would be to help them maintain facilities and make sure they were accessible and clean and safe for kids.
In India the government was implementing a toilet-building programme, but people did not understand how to maintain the new toilets.
The Cleaner Toilets, Brighter Futures programme stepped in to help and as a result reach began to accelerate. “Schools act as community centres,” acknowledges Simran. “They’re places where lots of learnings can be shared out to the wider community.”
Fast forward to 2019, and Domestos meets its 25 million target one year early, then exceeds it by 3 million. “It happened because we re-evaluated and repositioned our intervention and our approaches. We brought it back to understanding what role a brand has to play in this space,” Simran says.
This winning purpose ensured Domestos’s impact on our business, with the brand achieving double-digit growth in the past three to four years.
Heather McCrea, Corporate Partnerships, UNICEF is also proud of what the partnership has accomplished. “We have achieved an enormous amount,” she says. “We are excited to think about the future.”

text About the author
Home Care President at Unilever and Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner at International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene
Peter has been Unilever’s Home Care President and a member of the Unilever
Leadership Executive since May 2019. Dr Lisa Ackerley is a Chartered
Environmental Health Practitioner with over 30 years of experience in the home
and public hygiene arenas.
You’re working together on a campaign in the UK – what is its aim and where will people see it?
Lisa: Indeed we are. Our aim is to teach people how to use the principles of targeted hygiene to help protect themselves from coronavirus and break the chain of infection. As a chartered environmental health practitioner, I’ve been on a communications crusade with Unilever over the last month, speaking to journalists and being interviewed for TV programmes and radio shows to help amplify this message.
Peter: As soon as this crisis broke out, our carelines in the UK and worldwide received a high volume of queries from consumers asking what products to use to kill coronavirus and how to disinfect their home. It was clear at that point that we needed to step in and complement the advice of government and public health bodies.
We did this by partnering with Dr Lisa Ackerley who was able to provide the general public with practical cleaning information, regardless of the brand they use, to ensure people are cleaning their homes effectively and safely.
As well as the media outreach that Lisa has been doing, our Domestos team has also launched a new TV advert to increase awareness on the importance of targeted hygiene using bleach, any bleach. Starting off in the UK, the campaign is now running in other markets around the world.
Tell us about targeted home hygiene – what is it and why is it so important in the home?
Lisa: Targeted home hygiene is simple; it is about making sure that you take hygiene measures in the right way at the right time, for example, washing your hands when your return home and disinfecting the surfaces that you and your family most frequently touch.
Coronavirus will only enter your home if it is brought in, either via someone who is infected, is carrying the virus on them, comes in, or via a contaminated item. The virus can survive on some surfaces for up to several days, during which time it can easily be picked up and transported to other surfaces or other people. That is why it is so important to think about what those frequently touched areas are – for example, door handles and banisters. Deep cleaning doesn’t always mean getting a safer result – the key is cleaning smarter!
How do the recommendations in this campaign align with advice from public health bodies?
Lisa: All our messaging in this campaign aligns with the advice given by leading health organisations, such as the World Health Organization, for creating hospital-grade disinfectant. A solution of one-part bleach to nine-parts water is what we are recommending. Based on the different strengths of bleach on the market, this ratio will always make a potent enough solution.
Most people have bleach in their cupboard, but many think it should only be used for cleaning toilets. We wanted to ensure that the public knows how to use bleach on other surfaces too, and how to do that safely.
The campaign reinforces clear safety guidance about handling bleach. For instance, always keeping bleach out of the reach of children, never ingesting or inhaling bleach solutions, always wearing gloves, and never mixing bleach with anything other than cold water.
Peter: At a time of crisis, it is more important than ever that we equip the public with advice endorsed by public health bodies and experts. In fact, the latest Edelman Trust Barometer (2020) showed that 90% of consumers believe brands should ‘partner with government and relief agencies to address the crisis’. We have therefore made it our mission to use our scale to amplify the advice given by Public Health England and the World Health Organization.
Dr Lisa Ackerley’s advice on how to practice targeted hygiene at home
How long can the virus survive on different surfaces?
Coronavirus can last on surfaces for a few hours or a few days, depending on the type of surface. That’s why regular and targeted hygiene practices are so important.
What are the areas we should concentrate on cleaning the most?
You should think about the surfaces that are frequently touched on entry to the home by you or your family. These often include, but are not limited to:
Front door handles
Internal door handles
Staircase banister
Fridge handles
Cupboard handles
Counter tops
Kettle handle
Bathroom taps
Kitchen taps
Toilet flush handle or button
How often would you recommend cleaning? Is there a daily or weekly routine we should be adopting?
The frequency of disinfecting will depend on the numbers of people in your household. Targeted home hygiene should take place whenever someone in your household returns from outside. This starts with handwashing, but also includes anything that has been touched on the way to the wash basin. It is important to remember that coronavirus will only enter our homes if someone comes in who is infected or carrying it on them, or when a contaminated item is brought into the home.
If you are living in a shared household, where people are going out to work or the supermarket, then there is an increased risk of someone in your household carrying coronavirus, but with no symptoms. In those circumstances, targeted hygiene is even more important, and the frequency of disinfecting frequently touched surfaces needs to increase.
Why is bleach so good at killing germs and viruses?
Bleach is a powerful oxidising agent which destroys virus particles.
Is any bleach suitable? Are sprays and wipes as effective?
The recommended product for killing coronavirus is sodium hypochlorite bleach, which is a powerful disinfectant. This is commonly known as thick bleach, which people often use to clean their toilets, but it can also be diluted at home to clean your floors and frequently touched areas. Some brands also offer bleach disinfectant sprays. As with all cleaning products, always read the label to see what the products are designed to do, and to ensure they are used correctly and safely.
What is a diluted bleach solution and how can I make one safely at home?
Bleach needs to be diluted properly in order to be effective and safe to use as a cleaning solution.
Wearing household gloves, place a measuring jug in the sink and mix nine-parts cold water to one-part bleach – for example 450ml to 50ml (10 teaspoons)
Place the solution in a labelled container and, wearing household gloves, use a clean cloth to apply
Replace the solution daily
Are there any surfaces where bleach should not be used?
Bleach is not suitable for use on every surface. To be sure, you should always check the manufacturer’s label and never use bleach on surfaces other than those directed on the bottle.
text Back in March, shortly after the World Health Organization characterised Covid-19 as a pandemic, we introduced a wide-ranging set of measures to support global and national efforts to help tackle the spread of the virus.
We are contributing €100 million through donations of soap, sanitiser, bleach and food, as well as leveraging our procurement network to acquire much-needed medical equipment for organisations around the world.
We are also making available €500 million of cash flow relief for our most vulnerable small and medium-sized suppliers and small-scale retail customers whose businesses rely on Unilever.
In addition, we are working with the UK’s Department for International Development to fund a global programme that aims to reach up to a billion people, raising hygiene awareness and changing behaviour.
Here are just a few examples of how our efforts are making a difference around the world.
Africa: Ramping up supply and extending our medical facilities
We’re driving up soap production across Africa to address shortages of this core hygiene product. We’ve also teamed up with local suppliers to produce Lifebuoy hand sanitisers that we used to import from India. This is helping to meet a huge rise in consumer demand for a fast and effective way to reduce the risk of infection, especially for those who have to travel and work in Africa’s crowded cities and marketplaces where water for handwashing is often lacking.
We are also scaling up handwashing programmes throughout the continent. For example, in Ghana, we have extended the reach of our Lifebuoy handwashing programme by placing hygiene stations at bus terminals so people can wash their hands before and after travelling. The stations provide free soap alongside information about how to wash hands properly. As with all our handwashing programmes, we hope this will become a habit for everyone.
With over 60,000 workers and their dependents living in our tea estate villages in Kenya and Tanzania, we’ve worked with communities and authorities on safety protocols, upgraded our hospitals with extra ICU ventilators and built testing capacity. We’ve also got our schools and sports centres ready to convert to treatment centres, so we can isolate and treat patients if we face a major outbreak.
Our sales staff and factories are working hard to supply the hundreds of thousands of market traders, small distributors and local stores who rely on us for a living with the stock they need. These supplies are also essential for African consumers, most of whom can’t afford to buy in bulk and rely on local markets for regular supplies of essentials in small quantities.
Australia: Donating to food banks and helping the hospitality sector
In answer to government calls for businesses to use their manufacturing capabilities to help with the supply of protective products, we rapidly repurposed our deodorant production facility in New South Wales to bring Lifebuoy back to Australia and New Zealand with a new aerosol hand sanitiser. Around 150,000 of the new-format cans from the first production run were donated to Foodbank Australia.
With many businesses encouraging employees to adhere to social distancing, Australia’s food banks have lost out on support from several corporate volunteers who usually help package up food donations. We have provided funding to help the Foodbank charity employ paid casual workers to prepare the food parcels instead, ensuring these much-needed supplies can still be shared.
Our Food Solutions business has partnered with Yume, an online marketplace for surplus food, to launch Yume For Distributors. The idea is to help distributors who have been left with excess stock, due to the sudden closure of hospitality outlets, sell to others that are seeing a surge in demand. The partnership brings together Yume’s technology and our extensive industry knowledge.
Asia: Collaborating with UNICEF and connecting restaurants with diners
In India, we cut the prices of our handwash and floor cleaners while, at the same time, ramping up production. We’re collaborating with UNICEF on a mass communication campaign to inform the public about handwashing. And we’re part of a government initiative to convert small neighbourhood ‘Kirana’ stores into ‘Suraksha Stores’ (sanitised retail outlets) selling daily essentials. Read more about the steps we’re taking in India.
In Bangladesh, we’re working with BRAC, the world’s largest NGO, to raise awareness of personal hygiene, social distancing and respiratory etiquette, and to change behaviours in marginalised communities. We reached approximately 1 million people by initiating door-to-door dissemination of key messages to combat the virus and distributed 500,000 sachets of Lifebuoy handwash.
In Singapore, Unilever Foods Solutions partnered with marketplace platform Carousell to launch #SupportLocal, an initiative that enables 180,000 food and beverage businesses in South East Asia to connect with local diners. Through our Unilever International business, we are also distributing 14,000 care packages to 114 hawker centres. Hawkers play a key role in keeping Singapore running by providing good, affordable food.
In Myanmar, our Supply Chain team has, for the first time, used an almost fully dedicated train of the national rail system as a solution to the shortage of truck drivers and trucks during lockdown. This meant we were still able to transport finished products from our manufacturing plant in Mandalay to Yangon and serve the southern part of the country despite a lockdown.
Europe: Making ventilators and ensuring the vulnerable get help
In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we launched the Corona Hotline, a freephone call centre staffed by Unilever employees that connects charities and volunteers with people in need. It’s aimed primarily at older people who aren’t able to access information online, and those with isolation or mobility challenges who struggle to find out what help is available locally.
In the Netherlands, we have donated food and hygiene products to food banks and other organisations as stockpiling has left them with a shortfall in regular donations. We’re also supporting catering entrepreneurs by backing the helpdehoreca.nl website. Here, people can buy vouchers to redeem later at a favourite café or restaurant, so owners receive much-needed income while closed.
In the UK & Ireland, we have donated £3.5 million worth of products so far to charities, food banks, hospitals and frontline workers. We have adapted production lines to make hand sanitiser which we’re donating to the NHS and joined a consortium making ventilators. We have also used our expertise in 3D printing and laser cutting technologies to produce protective visors for staff at local hospitals.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, our activities largely centre on supporting charities in our local communities, especially NGOs, homes for the elderly and food banks. Unilever Food Solutions and our Hellmann’s, Knorr and Lipton brands donated over 13 tons of products to national food banks and to a project that delivers meals to seniors and vulnerable single mothers in Prague.
South America: Supporting favela families and getting SMEs online
In Brazil, we’re working with brewing company Heineken to manufacture a special batch of Cif household cleaner. We’re producing a run of 270,000 bottles of the alcohol-based sanitiser to distribute to socially-disadvantaged families in São Paulo’s favelas. It is hoped the product will benefit around 2 million residents, helping them protect their homes against the spread of Covid-19.
In Argentina, we’re operating factories at maximum capacity to increase production of critical supplies such as soap, surface cleaner and bleach. We have adapted production lines to make alcohol gel and hand soap (as we have in Bolivia). And we’re using our marketing spend to promote prevention, responsible consumption messages and activities to do at home.
Also in Argentina, we’re supporting small businesses in our value chain. Banks are currently only open to pensioners, so we have moved many of our partners and suppliers from cash and cheque payments and trained them in electronic transfers. And we’re partnering with on-demand delivery companies, such as Rappi, to get essential products to consumers, particularly the elderly and vulnerable.
In Colombia, we started operations on the remaining three production lines at our new Palmira factory, ahead of schedule, to guarantee the supply of shampoo, conditioner and softener. This meant securing the necessary regulatory approvals virtually – something that would ordinarily be carried out through a site visit.
US: Feeding the needy and organising a day of service
In the US, the broad set of measures in our United for America initiative includes donations of food, soap, personal hygiene and home cleaning products to Feeding America, which supports a national network of 200 food banks. We also donated more than 200,000 face masks to hospitals to help protect the lives of healthcare professionals.
As part of this initiative, Hellmann’s set up a Food Relief Fund that will provide $1 million to feed frontline workers and people in need in New York City, the birthplace of the brand. Together with food delivery marketplace Grubhub, we have teamed up with local restaurants to provide individually-catered meals to healthcare workers at three of the city’s hospitals as the first phase of this initiative.
Additionally, Dove and Vaseline donated $2 million to Direct Relief to go towards Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), ventilators and medicines for healthcare workers on the front lines in the US.
We’re organising a Day of Service on 21 May to provide an additional $12 million of support for those in need. On this day, the equivalent value of every product we make in Unilever US factories will be donated, employees across the country will be invited to volunteer for the cause, and we will dedicate our ad and marketing spend to non-profits on the front lines. We hope many of our partners and peers will join us.

text All our brands – from our soaps and shampoos to our ice creams and beauty products – rely on hundreds of different raw materials every single day. The smooth running of our business depends on our being able to source these materials in the markets where we need them, at the times when we need them and in the volumes we need them.
We are ever mindful of this reliance. We are also mindful that the planet’s resources are finite. At Unilever, maintaining the regenerative capacity of our shared planet is an overarching and longstanding priority.
100% sustainable: a transformational target
This is why, back in 2010, we set ourselves the goal of sourcing 100% of our agricultural raw materials sustainably. Of all our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) goals, this was perhaps the most ambitious. We are currently at 62% – which is short of our target, but up considerably from 14% a decade ago.
Was it ever going to be possible to hit 100%? Perhaps not, reflects Jonathon Porritt, a leading sustainability expert and Special Adviser on the USLP. “But that didn’t impair the ambition level,” he says. “It didn’t make people give up; instead it made them think, how do we take this to the next level?”
Delivering on this next level is something we remain very much committed to. But we face numerous hurdles. The most substantive of these relates to the sheer variety of raw materials that we source. Take starch, for example, which we use right across our brand portfolio. Just one container of this multi-functional additive could easily contain 50 different plant ingredients.
The logistical exercise of tracing each and every one of these materials back to its original farm, field or plantation is very “lengthy and complex”, explains Petronella Meekers, Unilever’s Global Head of Sustainable Sourcing.
The twin challenges of complexity and volume
Tracing products back to their origin is essential to offering the guarantee of sustainability that we want and that consumers are increasingly requesting.
So, why exactly is achieving such traceability so complex and costly? The answer has to do with the nature of modern supply chains, which, as well as being highly efficient, are extremely global in reach and multi-layered in scope.
Typically, we are buying from large suppliers, who very often source from smaller suppliers, and so on down the chain. As a result, it is often not possible to gain full visibility of the entire chain. This problem is often most acute for those raw materials that undergo some form of processing before arriving at our factories – with starch, once more, an emblematic case in point.
A related challenge that we face connected with the nature of modern supply chains relates to volume. Buying is very much a numbers game. The greater the volume, the greater your leverage. Anyone who has bought a multi-pack product in a supermarket will know the price advantages this can bring. It is no different for us when we buy raw materials.
The amount of raw materials we purchase varies considerably. Large or small, however, these volumes are relatively insignificant in the context of the global market. So, even supposing we could map out the entire supply chain for yams, say, our ability to influence how yams are produced would be limited. Our buying power, relatively speaking, just isn’t big enough.
Despite these hurdles, our resolve to drive sustainability through our supply chain has not weakened over the last decade. We have experimented with different strategies and tested out different approaches. It has been a journey of ups and downs, but we have learnt many valuable lessons along the way.
Key categories: narrower focus for wider impact
The most important of these is to focus our efforts where we can have the highest impact. “Our 100% ambition still remains, and our predominant focus is on those materials where we have ‘line of sight to farm’, as we call it, and greatest buying power. This is where we feel we can most influence producers to adopt sustainable practices,” says Petronella.
This decision had led us to a list of 12 key ingredient categories to focus on, including all commodities such as sugar, palm oil, soy, cocoa, paper and board and tea. Collectively, these comprise about two-thirds of our total volume of agricultural raw materials, 88% of which are sustainably sourced.
To increase that influence, we will continue to work with farmers, suppliers, governments and civil society to promote sustainable agriculture and forestry systems beyond the boundaries of our own business needs. Global alliances such as the Consumer Goods Forum and the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform provide excellent platforms for doing this.
Collaborations with like-minded buyers are especially important. Take sugar. Back in 2012, we made our first purchase from Bonsucro, which represents sustainably certified sugar producers. Today, thanks to collective demand from hundreds of other buyers, Bonsucro’s certification stamp covers one-quarter of all land planted with sugar cane.
This collaborative approach will increasingly require us to work in new and even surprising ways. Our project with farmers in the drought-hit US state of Iowa offers a taste of what’s to come. Through this initiative, we are encouraging participating farmers to grow cover crops such as rye grasses or oats. For their main crops, these farmers tend to rotate between corn, which PepsiCo buys, and soy, which we buy. So, it makes sense to run the project together with PepsiCo – which is exactly what we are doing.
Radical transparency: achieving all-round assurance
Another area where our work will continue is the promotion of chain-of-custody transparency in our critical supply chains.
We are making steady progress here, as our efforts in the palm oil sector demonstrate. Back in 2014, we began asking our palm oil suppliers to provide GPS coordinates for the mills that they source from. This gave us visibility on over 1,800 mills – around two-thirds of the total number of mills at the time.
Across all our key category areas, we will continue to push for more producers to achieve sustainable certification and drive impacts. Equally, we also want to find innovative ways to carry on increasing supply chain transparency, especially for the most complex raw materials. We have started with publishing our supplier lists for tea, soybean oil and paper and board.
We have come a long way, but much more still remains to be done, says Petronella. “We want greater assurances that the impacts we wish to see, such as no deforestation, regenerative practices and improved yields for smallholder, are being driven forward.”
Lessons for the future
Continue working in partnership with farmers, suppliers, governments and civil society to promote sustainable agriculture and forestry systems.
Find innovative ways to drive change, not only within the boundaries of our own business needs but also at the level of entire supply chains – ingredient by ingredient.
Strengthen the business case for sustainable agriculture by driving down the cost of traceability and assurance, and by driving up demand for sustainably produced materials.

text Looking after the soil is one of the most important jobs a farmer can do.
According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, a third of the world’s soil is now moderately to highly degraded.
But we can do something about this problem before it’s too late.
In Iowa in the US, we're working with soy farmers and our soy oil suppliers to increase the use of cover crops as a way of protecting the soil. This enhances the sustainability of this key ingredient for our Hellmann's brand.
Cover crops can also play a vital role in mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture, as well as helping prevent erosion and protecting water to positively impact local ecosystems.
We spoke to Stefani Millie Grant, Senior Manager, External Affairs and Sustainability for Unilever North America, and Ben Crook, Senior Director, Dressings & Condiments for Unilever North America, to find out more about the programme.
Why is this programme centred in Iowa?
This is where we get most of our soy oil. Unilever and Hellmann’s have been working with farmers in Iowa since 2013 on sustainable sourcing. In 2018, we relaunched the programme to focus on cover crops and soil health. We had about 120 farmers take part in year one and 300 in year two.
We are growing the programme to eventually include 700–800 farmers. That’s enough to supply 100% of the oil needed for Hellmann’s in the US. And we’re also now replicating this successful approach with a similar programme for Hellmann’s in Mexico.
PepsiCo also offers the same cover crop programme to its corn farmers. The company sources corn in the same supply shed as we source beans. Corn and soy are the standard crop rotation for farmers in Iowa, so they are likely supplying to both companies.
What is the problem with soil erosion in Iowa?
Over decades, through both severe droughts and heavy rains, the nutrient-rich soils of Iowa have been steadily declining. Along with the soil decline, nutrients are running into the Mississippi River and creating the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
Add the increasingly extreme weather events, and farmers are not just losing soil. In many cases, they are starting to lose their livelihoods as their fields become unplantable or they are unable to get into the fields to harvest and sell their crops.
Why does this matter so much to Unilever?
Crops like soy are usually grown by family-owned farms, who sell to processors and suppliers that in turn sell to us. One such family is the Sutters, who have been growing soy for Hellmann’s for three generations, soon to be four. Watch the film below to meet the family.
Supporting our farmers in implementing practices that renew the land for future generations isn’t just good business sense, it’s the right thing to do.
As extreme climate events are becoming a more frequent occurrence, so too are more frequent crop failures. If the land is unable to grow quality nutritious crops, it will be difficult to produce the quality ingredients we use for our brands.
What’s more, as soil health declines, so does the nutritional value of our food. The food we share with family and friends today has up to 25% fewer nutrients than 50 years ago.
What are cover crops and why do we need them?
These are crops that a farmer can plant, usually in the late autumn, to protect the soil after harvest until the next growing season. They are not usually harvested and monetised like the main crop.
Typically, these would be rye grasses, oats or radishes. Although there are opportunities to use a more diverse range of crops, for example pennycress, which is an oilseed.
However, a lot of farmers today no longer use cover crops, as they may have done in previous generations.
In part, this is because they have had access to modern farming technologies and synthetic fertilisers, which can provide good harvests in the short term. But this can put the long-term health of the soil at risk.
Cover crops help slow soil erosion and the loss of nutrients by keeping roots in the ground year-round. This can increase the amount of organic matter in the soil, enhance water availability and smother weeds.
They help control pests and diseases, increase biodiversity and attract pollinators. Over time, they can decrease the need for inputs such as fertilisers and chemicals. By helping retain nutrients, they are also a way to act on climate change, by reducing the greenhouse gases associated with agriculture.
By contrast, bare fields between crop cycles and the practice of heavy tillage reduces the amount of carbon being locked away in the soil and releases much of what is already there, in addition to the loss of the soil itself.
What exactly do farmers gain from taking part?
There are three aspects to the programme – financial investment, technical support and social engagement.
Investment is critical because planting cover crops is an outlay for farmers, often with little financial return, so it may not make business sense in the short term. The farmers will see rewards many times over, but it needs a long-term view. We provide financial support per acre for cover cropping, and we help farmers apply for federal and state funding where available.
In terms of technical assistance, we partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), who are known within the state as the experts on cover crops. All farmers have a consultation with PFI to help answer their questions regarding cover crops and soil health practices. Questions may include what seed mix to use and at what rate, and the amount of fertiliser required.
The social engagement aspect is about building a network that the farmers can turn to for support as they try these new practices. When a new farmer joins, they get a welcome call from another farmer who is using cover crops offering support and to be a resource. Farmers also attend learning days and webinars to exchange best practices, as well as lessons learned around soil health.

Is it possible to see the impact of cover crops?
Not always on the surface, but within the soil you can absolutely tell. Healthy soil is rich and dense, and you will find many earthworms. Unhealthy soil is usually powdery and dry with minimal earthworms.
Earthworm tunnels allow roots to penetrate deeper, where they can reach extra moisture and nutrients. Their channelling loosens and aerates the soil and improves drainage.
The impact is most noticeable during rainfall. Healthy soil absorbs the water whereas on unhealthy soil, the water just runs off, taking dirt and nutrients with it.
Farmers that have been using cover crops for several years were better able to withstand the heavy spring rains Iowa experienced this year – something that is expected to get more severe with the impacts of climate change. Many were able to get into their fields to plant earlier than their neighbours and some report that they are now using fewer herbicides.
One farmer shared with us that he can tell the soil health of a field when he drives onto it with his tractor by the firmness of the ground. In fields with healthy soils, the ground is firm under the tractor. Where the soil is unhealthy, he can feel the ground give under the weight.
How should we be taking better care of soil?
Everyone has a role to play in protecting soils for future generations.
Governments can adopt policies that support sustainable food and agriculture. Other companies can join us as partners in programmes such as this, or with industry initiatives like the Sustainable Food Policy Alliance. And we urge individuals to play their part by making the right choice in terms of the brands they buy.
This isn’t something that any one organisation alone can fix. But working together, everything is possible.
text Ten years ago we launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), a set of goals for our global business designed to help make sustainable living commonplace around the world. Our Lifebuoy soap brand set itself the ambitious target of improving the handwashing behaviours of more than 1 billion people by 2020.
By significantly scaling up its education programmes to highlight the importance of handwashing with soap, it passed that milestone back in 2019 and it’s not stopping there. Here’s the story behind the numbers.
Explaining the impact of soap
According to UNICEF, a child dies from pneumonia or diarrhoea every 23 seconds somewhere in the world. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective ways of helping to reduce the spread of such diseases, and teaching consumers about this life-saving fact has been Lifebuoy’s mission for more than 100 years.
Outreach education programmes have long been part of this process, with Lifebuoy campaigns visiting schools and villages across its markets to remind communities to wash their hands at key points during the day. Before eating, for example, or after using the toilet.
The approach worked well, but things would have to change to bring those vital handwashing messages to vast new audiences.
Changing habits for a lifetime
In 2011, Lifebuoy teams from all over the world came together to re-think the strategy. Over the years that followed, they focused on bringing the brand’s educational approach to consumers in new ways to drive lasting behaviour change, and forging partnerships to take outreach programmes to new frontiers.
Reflecting on how the strategy took shape, Global Sustainability Director Sarah McDonald explains: “We started seeing enormous scaling up happening every year, and unlocking some enormous strategic key partnerships with ministries of health and education through governments, and with NGO partners, to deliver the programme.”
Innovation has played a part in extending Lifebuoy’s impact in recent years too, with Lifebuoy’s Mobile Doctorni programme delivering easily accessible health advice to parents straight through their mobile phones – sometimes the only technology available in remote rural locations. Lifebuoy also launched specific TV ads to share handwashing education with a mass audience, again designed to remind viewers of soap’s ability to help remove germs. These commercials have been independently proven to drive behaviour change too.
“Humbled by the responsibility”
“I feel humbled by the responsibility,” says Global Brand Vice President Kartik Chandrasekhar, of Lifebuoy’s work so far. “But I feel optimistic about the fact that we will take our behaviour-change programme and take our brand’s purpose and social mission, and deliver them with even more scale than in the last ten years. This year, and for years to come.”
With the world now in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, making handwashing with soap a lifelong habit is as important than ever. Until a vaccine is created, the humble bar of soap remains one of humanity’s best hopes.
text Around half a billion people across the globe are smallholder farmers, who rely on modest plots of land to provide food for their income and themselves.
However, to earn a living, they often sell their best crops. This leaves them with a monotonous diet that usually contains too many starchy foods such as rice, maize and wheat.
While inexpensive and filling, this kind of diet lacks important vitamins and minerals. And that carries several health risks, including decreased resistance to infections and impeded brain and body development.
Malnutrition also has a knock-on economic effect. Research estimates that adults who were malnourished as children earn at least 20% less on average than those who weren’t*, and national economies lose, on average, 10% of GDP annually due to malnutrition** as a result of early deaths and decreased productivity.
To help tackle this issue, we joined forces with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and IDH (the Sustainable Trade Initiative) to develop a programme called Seeds of Prosperity, which promotes the consumption of nutritious foods and a diverse, balanced diet.
Together, we have recently implemented the programme at Unilever Tea Tanzania, reaching over 6,500 plantation workers and local tea farmers and, in turn, their families. And the results are promising.
Those taking part report improved diets, a better understanding of how to use their budget to buy healthier foods and greater awareness of nutrition within their families. Management believes that the programme has contributed to the decreased cases of anaemia in the local hospital.
As Abdallah Hamadi, Unilever Tea Tanzania’s Operations Excellence Manager, says: “Improving the health of the farmers in our value chain is a moral responsibility, but it also secures essential supplies, expands the market for our products and increases the resilience of our business model. Without a healthy workforce, we can’t have a healthy business.”
“Poor quality diets are the greatest driver of disease globally. Ensuring individuals have a varied diet with the right nutrients can be transformative for people, businesses and economies,” adds Lawrence Haddad, Executive Director of GAIN. “It is great to see Unilever demonstrating that companies can support nutritious diets for workers in their supply chains as a core part of sustainable business.”

How the programme works
Seeds of Prosperity informs workers and their families about diverse diets and why they matter. It aims to increase the number of food groups they consume daily, improving their intake of essential vitamins and minerals. It also provides seeds so households can cultivate vegetable gardens and fruit trees.
The programme reinforces messages about the importance of nutrition through posters around the workplace and at key focal points in the community. It also includes reminder messages on payslips, which are important documents for the workers.
Trained ‘educators’ then pass on these messages to raise awareness in the wider community and bring about additional change, for example, with mothers and with children in schools.
This approach is clearly working and maybe even reaching further than we anticipated. As Welfare Manager Dickson Mseti says: “The most rewarding part was when I visited a local restaurant and they were speaking about food groups. They were not part of the programme, but it shows the message is getting through and spreading.”
From pilot project to transformational change
Since starting life as a pilot project in India in 2016, we have now implemented Seeds of Prosperity in our tea supply chains in Kenya, Malawi and, most recently, Tanzania. The results have been positive, with significant improvements in nutrition and hygiene practices in most farmer groups that have taken part.
To date, the programme has reached over 300,000 people. Given its successful societal impact, we’re now working on scaling the project further to bring about transformational change across the tea sector.
“Through the Seeds of Prosperity programme, we have brought more nutritious diets to 300,000 people in India, Kenya and Tanzania,” says Jordy van Honk, Global Director of Agriculture Commodities at IDH. “We are proud to have worked with Unilever and GAIN to demonstrate the potential for scale for the tea sector to bring more nutritious diets to tea workers and farmers.”

text Poverty is one of the biggest and most complex problems our world currently faces. People living in poverty lack access to resources such as food, education, finance, sanitation and medical care. In short, their basic human needs simply aren’t being met.
Fighting poverty is therefore an enormous challenge. And in 2020 it has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. In its latest report, The World Bank says the pandemic, and the global recession that is set to follow, will push an additional 150 million people into extreme poverty by 2021.
Where people are suffering, we know we can play an important role by using our scale for good.
Taking action on the major emergencies the world faces is one way we do this. For example, donations and emergency programmes were a key part of our initial response to the Covid-19. We put measures in place to protect lives and livelihoods by launching the Hygiene & Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC): a public–private partnership between Unilever and the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCOD) to curb the spread of Covid-19, with leading academics from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also in the core team.
The partnership aims to reach up to 1 billion people by investing £100 million in hygiene programmes, awareness campaigns and delivering products to those in the developing world.
But Covid-19’s impact on the economic landscape has only just begun. And just as there is no business case for enduring poverty, there is no quick fix to achieving its end.
Collaborating with others to achieve lasting change
Many argue that to really make an impact, a more inclusive form of capitalism is needed. We agree. It has long been clear that the current capitalist model needs repair.
Globalisation and capitalism are good for a business like ours, but globalisation and capitalism at the expense of people (and the planet) are not.
We believe that it is simply not possible to achieve long-term business success in a world which contains poverty, hunger and climate change. It’s why, in 2015, we publicly backed the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address these global issues.
Since then we have worked to harness our reach and scale as a business and take collective action with governments, NGOs, investors, consumers, suppliers and regulators to create systemic change.
Creating opportunities across our value chain to enhance livelihoods
Though poverty is commonly measured by levels of income, addressing it also requires tackling social exclusion because of gender, long-term unemployment, low income, poor skills or education.
Creating opportunities for women
A study by the McKinsey Global Institute shows that closing gender gaps in labour-force participation has the potential to add 12–25% to global GDP by 2025. In other words, when more women work, economies grow.
A total of 25% of the world’s population are women living in rural areas. And through projects such as our Shakti entrepreneurship programme in India, we offer women an opportunity to earn an income selling Unilever products door to door.
As of September 2019, 118,000 women were actively taking part in our Shakti distribution network in the country. And the programme has been extended to reach more than 100,000 women in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Guatemala, Myanmar and Colombia too.
Advancing financial inclusion for micro-businesses
Building new systems that widen access to finance for groups such as micro-entrepreneurs also helps to break down the barriers that can keep people in poverty.
In partnership with Mastercard in Kenya, and with funding from the CEO Partnership for Economic Inclusion, we created project Jaza Duka, which literally translates as ‘fill your shelves’.
The project enabled 12,000 small retailers to digitise their stocktaking, giving them better control over their inventories. This not only ensured they had a steadier stream of income but also that they could build the credentials needed for banks to give them access to short-term loans that will help their businesses grow.
Supporting smallholders to weather market shocks and fluctuations
Tackling poverty also means helping others build financial resilience, such as ensuring that the smallholder farmers providing ingredients for our brands can be resilient to bad weather or a bad harvest.
One of the many projects we run with our farmer communities is project DiRev. This saw us work with 448 smallholder cocoa farmers in southern Côte d’Ivoire to establish a maize crop alongside their main cocoa fields. And it proved useful from the start. When drought threatened the cocoa harvest, farmers had more than one crop to sell.
Using our brand purpose to provide hope and opportunity
Our supply chain is not the only part of our business we leverage to make a difference.
Our 28 sustainable living brands are responsible for 75% of our overall growth. Each one supports a positive change for people and the planet. This includes providing people with access to basic hygiene needs.
In the US, 30% of profits from our brand Right To Shower is used to give people experiencing homelessness access to a shower every day.
For almost a decade, Domestos has worked in partnership with UNICEF to tackle sanitation issues and helped over 28 million people gain improved access to a toilet.
And Lifebuoy’s Help a Child Reach 5 campaign and its lifesaving handwashing message have reached hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Our boldest action is still collective action
It’s crucial that we don’t lose sight of the issues that fuel inequality, and we must continue to collaborate with others to change the systems that contribute to extreme poverty.
As the world readies itself to face a global recession, we will continue to focus on what we can do to transform global food systems, empower smallholder farmer livelihoods, advance diversity and inclusion, solve chronic malnutrition and promote economic inclusion.
All of this calls for a fundamental change to how we do business, and we will collaborate with others to change how the current capitalist model works to help end poverty.
text It’s Global Handwashing Day, so what better time for Lifebuoy – the world’s No.1 hygiene soap brand* – to kickstart its new movement called ‘H for Handwashing’.
It takes inspiration from UNICEF’s childhood development research which demonstrates that the right support and interventions in the early years of life can significantly boost child development, helping them to grow, learn and thrive.
The new movement uses this research to focus on how, for generations, children have been taught letters of the alphabet through simple associations with everyday references such as ‘A’ for apple, ‘B’ for ball and ‘C’ for cat. Starting this month, Lifebuoy wants to fundamentally change the way the letter ‘H’ is taught.
No longer will ‘H’ stand for horse, hat or even home. ‘H’ must stand for Handwashing.
The €30 million, multi-year campaign – which is principally aimed at pre-school, primary school kids and adolescents (spanning ages 2–17) – will involve co-creating programmes with education, health, humanitarian and behaviour-change experts to integrate good hygiene practices.
“For more than a century, Lifebuoy has been on a mission to change handwashing behaviours,” says Kartik Chandrasekhar, Lifebuoy’s Global Brand VP. “We’re reaffirming our commitment by working with education experts to create an unforgettable hand hygiene reminder to ensure that handwashing with soap becomes a lesson nobody forgets.”
Bringing the movement to life
In collaboration with the Global Handwashing Partnership, Lifebuoy has set up the ‘H for Handwashing’ resource page. It’s accessible to everyone and will enable NGOs, governments, schools, teachers, pupils and the public to join the movement.
Lifebuoy will also partner with a range of organisations including Sesame Street and Save the Children. In collaboration with the Sesame Workshop, the brand will create premium educational storytelling for children and caregivers. This content will be aimed at – and distributed to – families across Asia and Africa in 2021.
Commenting on the partnership, Gwen Hine, Executive Director of Global Programmes at humanitarian organisation Save the Children, says: “We look forward to collaborating on this important initiative to embed positive health, nutrition and hygiene behaviours during children’s early years, working alongside communities, health workers and educators.”
The pandemic has put a spotlight on handwashing
The importance of handwashing with soap has been thrust into the global spotlight amid the ongoing pandemic.
That’s why, in March, we started working with the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to fund a global programme called the Hygiene & Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC).
The HBCC represents a £100 million contribution to raising awareness on the importance of handwashing and good hygiene among the world’s most vulnerable populations, particularly against the backdrop of the global pandemic.
It’s amazing what you can achieve in a day
Global Handwashing Day is dedicated to increasing awareness about the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent diseases and save lives. Now its 12th year, the day was co-founded by Lifebuoy and the Global Handwashing Partnership.
Each year, Global Handwashing Day is celebrated by over 200 million people in more than 100 countries. Last year saw one of the largest brand activations yet for Lifebuoy, reaching more than 25 million people through digital and over 3.4 million children through school visits.
“At Lifebuoy, we have championed handwashing for over a decade, by running the world’s largest behaviour-change programme that has reached over 1 billion** people,” says Samir Singh, our Global EVP for Skin Cleansing and Oral Care.
“Starting this October, we are advocating for greater emphasis on hand hygiene education through a movement to fundamentally change the way the alphabet is taught – H must stand for Handwashing.”

text How it started
In 1913 an entrepreneurial butcher called Thomas Wall decided to counteract the summer dip in sales of sausages by branching out into selling ice cream. World War 1 put his idea on hold. But when Unilever purchased the business in 1922 and large commercial freezers began arriving from the US, the Wall’s ice cream brand was brought to life.
Demand for Wall’s saw vendors travelling the streets of London to sell ice cream via horse and cart. It wasn’t long before bike deliveries were added to the mix. By 1939, Wall’s fleet of tricycle salespeople was 8,500 strong.
Fast forward 20 years and construction began for Wall’s first state- of-the-art factory. In 1962, at full capacity, it produced 90,000 gallons of ice cream each day. And it’s still in operation today, making 4 million Cornetto ice creams every week and more than 1 billion ice creams every year.
The brand has come a long way from selling vanilla ices on the streets of London. Today, Wall’s sells more than 40 brands, many of them local to specific markets. For more information, read the ‘It might surprise you to learn’ section below. What’s more, its ice creams are sold in 52 countries around the world.
How it’s going
There are five Unilever brands in the top ten bestselling ice creams in the world. Two of them – Cornetto and Carte D’Or – are part of Wall’s Heartbrand portfolio.
In 2021, sales from Unilever’s Ice Cream portfolio reached €6.9 billion in turnover, with underlying sales growth of 5.7%. Wall’s was one of three €1 billion ice cream brands.
In Q3 2022, the year Wall’s celebrated its 100th birthday, underlying sales growth for Unilever’s Ice Cream business group was 13.2%, with 12.0% from price and 1.0% from volume.
Today, out-of-home purchases still play a significant part in ice cream sales, but the Covid pandemic has opened new quick commerce channels to supply ice cream to consumers.
Unilever’s Ice Cream Now division caters for in-home eating by rapidly delivering our products to consumers in 35 countries.
Getting ice cream to consumers fast and without spoiling has been achieved through partnerships with delivery services such as Grubhub and Uber Eats, alongside tapping into Wall’s existing network of freezer cabinets in local stores and restaurants. This network works to ensure brands such as Carte D’Or go from an online order to delivery to the consumer’s doorstep in less than 30 minutes.
In 2021, this combination of speed and response to consumer demand saw this part of our ice cream business grow by 60%.
The purpose that powers it
There is something for everyone in the Wall’s ice cream portfolio, and that breadth of choice has the ability to drive happiness among all age groups, as well as melt down barriers between different communities.
Wall’s is working hard to leverage that. To build a happier and more inclusive world, one lick at a time.
Alongside partners such as Symrise and Giz and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Wall’s is working with smallholder farmers to improve yields and livelihoods. Their work has reached 40,000 people in 9,000 households, across 76 villages in the Sava region of Madagascar that help supply its vanilla requirements.
What’s more, every brand it sells in its kids’ range of ice creams adheres to Wall’s Responsibly Made for Kids promise.
The promise is based on three pillars, designed to help parents and care-givers make informed choices for their children. These are Responsible Communication through advertising; Responsible Selling with our Responsibly Made for Kids mark; and Responsible Development, which includes an undertaking that every ice cream in our kids’ range has no more than 110 calories and a maximum of 12 grams of sugar per portion and 3 grams of saturated fat.
Brand new ideas
Twister Peek-a-Blue 
The original Twister ice cream was launched by Wall’s in 1982. Fast forward 40 years and the brand extended its range with the launch of Twister Peek-a-Blue. The new lolly references the original Twister shape, but is reimagined to look like twisted, braided strips of ice cream. Created using fruit purée and fruit juice concentrates, it delivers a delicious melon and strawberry flavour combination and meets all of the criteria of the Responsibly Made for Kids promise at 66 calories per portion.
Cornetto Love Rose
Cornetto Love Rose marries the brand’s signature crunchy cone with a crown in the shape of a rose. Delicious and instagrammable, the novel shape is created using a patented nozzle that replicates the petals of a rose. It’s available in strawberry cheesecake and peach flavours, and wherever possible has a paper lid to protect the rose instead of a plastic one. Cornetto Rose is currently available in Thailand, Indonesia, Turkey, the EU and China.
Wall’s Mini Bites 
Indulgence, portion control or sampling just a little bite of new flavours. Whatever the motivation, snacking is here to stay. According to a recent report,88% of consumers say a balanced diet can include a little indulgence and Wall’s is here for it. In 2021 the brand launched Wall’s Ice Cream Mini Bites in two flavours, vanilla and strawberry, in Australia, the UK, Thailand and Indonesia. Each box contains ten mini treats to share with all the family.
Carte D’Or Premium Desserts for professional kitchens 
The Carte D’Or brand began over 40 years ago as a restaurant desserts brand in Paris, proudly served by chefs in the home of gastronomy. That heritage of culinary expertise remains at its heart today. To this end, this year, alongside its consumer offering, the brand launched a line of premium desserts for professional kitchens. These allow time-pressed chefs to create Carte D’Or Panna Cotta, Carte D’Or Crème Brûlée, Carte D’Or Lemon Mousse or Carte D’Or Chocolate Mousse consistently and speedily in three to four easy steps.
It might surprise you to learn…
In Italy, Wall’s is called Algida. In Germany, Langnese. In the Netherlands, Ola. In the US, Good Humor and in Brazil, Kibon. Wall’s might have different names in different markets but it’s the same delicious ice cream. Local names have been kept because each contains the history and reputation of the former brands. And all of them are united by their shared Heartbrand logo and its phiosophy to ‘Live from the Heart!’ Wherever customers see the Heartbrand logo around the world it means ‘Here there’s joy’.

text The introduction of our new Hellmann’s 100% recycled and recyclable plastic jars and bottles in North America marks another major milestone on the brand’s journey to exit virgin plastic, following on from their initial launch in Mexico last September.
Hellmann’s becomes the first dressings brand in the US to make the switch to 100% recycled bottles and jars, and we’ll also be leading industry change in Canada as the first to transition to PCR (post-consumer recycled) packaging.
This will cut our use of virgin plastic, per year, by around 13,000 tons in the US and 1,000 tons in Canada. This is the equivalent of 60 Statues of Liberty.
By the end of this year, our aim is that all Hellmann’s mayonnaise plastic jars and squeeze bottles – globally – will be 100% recycled and 100% recyclable.
The move supports our company-wide commitment to ensure that 100% of our plastic packaging will be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.
It will also help us achieve the new 2025 goals we set ourselves in October – to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging, and collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell.
Helping consumers do their bit
Around the world, sustainability is proven not to be a niche issue, nor is it a subject restricted to a single group like 'millennials' or 'green' consumers.
A study by the Kantar Worldpanel found that 78% of people globally admit to feeling better about themselves after buying products that they know to be sustainable or better for the environment.
And the responsibility is clearly with the companies and brands that make these products to own the issue. Findings in a separate Kantar study show that nearly half (48%) of all consumers worldwide expect manufacturers to take the lead on plastic packaging waste.
According to Benjamin Crook, Senior Marketing Director for Hellmann’s in North America: "Switching to recycled plastic has a positive impact on the environment by reducing the amount of bottles sent to landfills and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. At Hellmann's, we strive for sustainability in all that we do, including helping customers make a responsible choice while still enjoying the products they love.”
Tackling a tricky problem
In an ideal world, we would immediately change all our plastic packaging so it's fully recyclable and made from 100% recycled content. But for a host of reasons, that's trickier than it sounds.
Firstly, not all plastics can be recycled today, and it depends on the technologies available. For example, transparent PET (the material we use to make Hellmann's bottles and jars) is recyclable but flexible laminates (which we use in our sachets) are not. Having said that, sachet recycling is an area we’re working on intensely and making good progress.
What's more, the food industry requires the highest level of purity for reused plastic. This means that recycled PET collection and production is more labour intensive and carried out by fewer suppliers, making the material less widely available and more expensive.
Hellmann's has been working for some time to overcome these challenges. The launch in Mexico and this latest roll-out in North America is a big step forward in making all packs fully recyclable and made from 100% recycled materials.
As Christina Bauer-Plank, Global Brand VP for Hellmann's, says: "Eliminating virgin plastic from our packs is not easy, but it is the right thing to do. At Hellmann's, we're all about 'Real Taste and Less Waste', so the introduction of 100% recycled and recyclable jars and bottles is a very important step that contributes to building consumer preference while helping the planet.”
